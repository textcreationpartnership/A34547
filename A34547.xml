            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Preface.</head>
            <p>IT was the complaint of Doctor <hi>Eedes,</hi> that Reverend Dean of <hi>Worceſter</hi> long ago, the fatal miſery of theſe latter times hath made nothing good but in Shew, nothing true but in Opinion; when for Juſtice between Kingdom and Kingdom, the longeſt Sword hath eaten up the Law of Nations, and for Juſtice between Subject and Subject under the ſame Government Laws are loſt in the caſes of Law: And for the Preſerver of all, both Truth and Juſtice, Religion it ſelf is in a manner loſt in the Queſtions of Religion. Our Fathers (you ſee) complained that the dayes were bad; we have too much cauſe to cry out that they are worſe, and our fear is that yet we have not ſeen the worſt: That of the Heathen Poet will ſtill be verified; <hi>Aetas parentum pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor avis, tulit nos nequiores—mox daturos Progeniem vitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiorem.</hi> Never were more Queſtions among us raiſed about Religion then in theſe days, yet never leſs practice of the duties of Religion; We all cry up Religion with our mouths and lips, but deny the power of it in our Actions and in our Lives, ſo that we may ſay as that worthy <hi>Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker</hi> from <hi>Linacer</hi> did, <hi>Aut hoc non eſt Evangelium, aut nos non ſumus Evangelici;</hi> Either this is not the true Goſpel which we do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, or if it be the Truth, our Actions are not ſuitable to our Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor our Lives anſwerable to the truth of this Goſpel. We have marr'd the very face of Religion, being in Matters of Religion broken into as many Sects, Factions, Shreds, and Pieces almoſt as be Heads and Perſons among us. Every man generally differing in his Opinion one way or other from his Neighbour; we have Conformiſts, Non-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts, Separatiſts, Presbyterians, Independents, Anabaptiſts, Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <pb facs="tcp:64183:3"/> Some are of ſuch a croſs humour, high-conceited and contentious Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that they raiſe and foment vain Janglings, Differences, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputes about ſuch things as themſelves neither know nor underſtand; whom I may well liken to thoſe two <hi>Manlius</hi> ſpeaks of, who meeting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether fell in Diſcourſe, and at laſt to a hot diſpute about their Faith. One ſaid he was of Doctor <hi>Martins</hi> Religion, the other ſtood ſtiff that he was of Doctor <hi>Luthers</hi> Opinion, not knowing (poor Simpletons) that <hi>Martin</hi> and <hi>Luther</hi> were both the names of one man. Theſe diviſions in Opinion m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt needs cauſe great Diſtractions in the hearts of well-meaning people, who ſeeing the differences among us about Religion, and not knowing what to chuſe, or to whom to cleave, become very Atheiſts in their judgments, and reſolve to pitch upon no Religion at all. This we may lament; but ſo much liberty hath been given ſo long in theſe diſtracted times, and people generally grow ſo high that we have little hope to amend it; yet it lieth upon every one of us to give our helping hand, wherein we can to make up our Breaches, to heal our Rents and Wounds, and to give that information to our people in a mild and gentle way, (Seeing Ignorance is the general ground of all Errours, and that <hi>Natura vult Duci non Cogi)</hi> whereby they may come to ſee the Truth; and the true ſtate of things, and ſo by degrees may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to a better temper, with Gods bleſſing brought into the Unity of the Church, and may all endeavour to keep the Unity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace.</p>
            <p>Many ſtumble much at our Bock of Common Prayer Eſtabliſhed by Authority, and ſome of them I take to be good Chriſtians, honeſt, mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and well-meaning people; and have found by experience much of their Diſ-affection to it, doth lie upon their Miſtake through ignorance (not peeviſh wilfulneſs) becauſe they do not underſtand the true Grounds and Reaſons of the things therein contained and required, miſtaking much the right meaning of them.

               <p n="1">1. We find ſet Forms of Prayer preſcribed by God himſelf in the Old Teſtament, and by Chriſt and our Saviour in the New; and therefore we cannot but judge that they are allowed and approved of God. There were ſet Forms of Prayer preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to the people of God of old and uſed by them: To the Prieſts by <hi>Moſes</hi> from the mouth of God himſelf, <hi>Numb</hi> 6. 23. Another uſed by <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf, who had abundance of Spirit, both at the ſetting forward and reſting of the Ark, <hi>Numb.</hi> 10. 35, 36.

The 92 Pſalm was appointed for the Sabbath, and ſo uſed, and the 102. Pſalm was the Prayer of the Church. Chriſt himſelf in the New Teſtament gave a Form of Prayer to his Diſciples, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 1. Which the Directory tells us is not only a Patern of Prayer, but it ſelf a moſt Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive prayer, and recommended there to be uſed in the Prayers of the Church. And the Chriſtian Church hath been ſo far

Now be pleaſed to conſider rightly of it, doth not the ſame reaſon hold good with us? Have we not too much cauſe to complain of our Errours, Schiſms, Hereſies and Diviſions, and ſo juſt cauſe and reaſon upon the ſame grounds to tie all to one Form not upon any O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion that we conceive a ſet Form to be of an Abſolute neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but only expedient to ſtop Schiſms and Errours, to prevent thoſe Extravagancies, and to preſerve Unity and Order?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Be pleaſed without prejudice or any ſtrong over-ruling Affection or Paſſion, to take into your ſerious conſideration this Argument. If the Miniſters conceived Prayer which he doth make as the Mouth of the Congregation (wherein all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation doth or ſhould joyn with him in his ſuit to God for them, and in their behalf) is no ſtinting of the Spirit of God to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor counted unlawful though it be a form to them; why ſhould a Prayer conceived by others and made and framed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rules of prayer preſcribed to the Miniſter, to uſe for himſelf and the Congregation, be a ſtinting of the Spirit to him or them? That the Miniſters conceived prayer is a Form to the people and Congregation aſſembled, cannot be denyed;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64183:4"/> they are tied to it as to a Form, becauſe they may not vary from him in their hearts, but ought in their hearts to joyn every way with him in their Petitions to God; ſtill in their hearts going along with him for Matter, Form, and Manner of expreſſion: The tie in regard of a form is ſtill one and a like, if the people may be thus tied to the conceived prayer of their Miniſter (which is a form to them) why may not the Miniſter likewiſe be tied to a form conceived by others, made according to the rules of prayer, and preſcribed to him both to uſe and follow? If it be no ſtinting of the Spirit of God in the one, then how can it be in the other? We confeſs that without the help of the Spirit of God we cannot pray at all; that is pray aright ſo as to find acceptance with God: For the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> telleth us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5. We are not ſufficient of our ſelves to think any thing as of our ſelves, but our ſufficiency is of God; and <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 13 It is God which worketh in you the Will and the Deed even of his good pleaſure.

Floquent or Elegant Phraſes, or neat expreſſions; it is the heart God looks upon how that is affected, he regardeth the groans and deſires of the heart iſſuing from true faith, and proceeding from the Spirit of God as he telleth <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 14. 15. Why doſt thou cry unto me? Neither can we think that the Spirit of God excludeth reaſon and prudence, ſetting a mans Tongue ſo agoing, that he cannot rule it, and guide it, or ſtop it at his pleaſure.</p>

                  <label>Anſw</label> Thoſe words of our Saviour were ſpoken to the Woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> and are grounded on ver. 20. as an anſwer to her words, where ſhe ſpeaketh of the difference between the Jews and the Samaritans about the place of Gods worſhip. The Samaritans tied the place of Gods worſhip to that Mountain called <hi>Gerizim.</hi> The Jews to Jeruſalem; Chriſt telleth her that the time is now coming under the New Teſtament, that the worſhip of God ſhall be tied to no certain place, neither to that mountain, nor to Jeruſalem; but the true worſhippers ſhall worſhip God in Spirit and Truth. The word (Spirit) is there ſet againſt that Commandment which is called carnal, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 26. And (Truth) againſt the outward Ceremonies of the Law which were only ſhadows of things to come. The meaning of them then muſt be this, that under the New Teſtament Gods worſhip ſhall be tied to no certain place; neither ſhall it conſiſt in any outward corporal or carnal things, ſacrifices, purifyings, waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and the like Ceremonies of the Law; they ſhall all ceaſe and be ended in Chriſt: But the true worſhippers ſhall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him in ſpirit and truth; that is, in a ſpiritual manner, not with outward obſervances, but the inward Devotion of the heart and mind: (The mind is there called the Spirit, it is not meant of the Spirit of God, but of the mind, the ſpirit of man) with true faith, true love, reverence, obedience, holineſs and righteouſneſs. Now this we do acknowledge doth forbid and cut down all carnal worſhip, if any man think that the outward action of reading a prayer upon a Book or in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ook, is the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God; but no man can deny but a man may pray by the ſpirit of God, with ſighs and groans proceeding from Faith, when prayers are uttered after a preſcript form, or read upon a Book. And for the words of the Apoſtle, expoſitours give us the meaning thus: There is no cauſe why we ſhould faint under the burthen of our Afflictions, ſeeing prayers yield us a ſtrong defence, help, and comfort, which cannot be in vain becauſe they proceed from the ſpirit of God; likewiſe the ſpirit helpeth
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64183:5"/> our infirmities; beſides the ſupport of faith, hope, and patience (mentioned before) the ſpirit helpeth to bear up <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> burthen that we ſink not under it; for we know not what to pray as we ought, but the ſpirit maketh Interceſſion for us with groans which cannot be uttered; that is, the ſpirit doth move us and ſtir us up to prayer, and doth as it were dictate words, groans and ſighs within us; helpeth that dulneſs, ignorance, and blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in us, teaching us how and what to pray for: And he that ſearcheth the heart knoweth the meaning of the ſpirit. What ſighs and groans proceed from the ſpirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from the motion and breathing of the ſpirit, becauſe it maketh Interceſſion for the Saints according to the will of God. It teacheth the Saints to pray according to his will, it worketh in us thoſe wiſhes and deſires, and kindleth in our hearts thoſe earneſt, fervent, and ardent affections, ſighs, and groans, which pleaſe God. This we all acknowledge, that we can do nothing in prayer without the help of the ſpirit which ſtirreth up earneſt affections, deſires and groans in the heart; but this ſpirit of God doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude reaſon and prudence or any helpes that may be afforded us to forward us in that good duty, but joyneth as it were with them, and followeth them with his aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>In the performance of this duty of prayer, three things are eſpecially requiſite and needful.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To pray with Underſtanding, to know what we ſay, and what we pray for.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To pray in Faith, to come in the name of Chriſtians to ask thoſe things that are agreeable to Gods will, believing that God both can and will hear us, and help us, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer our Petitions as far as he ſhall ſee and judge fitting for his own glory and our good.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To pray in the Spirit, with zeal, fervency, intention of mind and ſpirit, and with earneſtneſs and true Devotion of the heart.</p>
               <p>Now who can ſay but a man may pray with Underſtanding, pray in Faith, and pray in the Spirit with true Devotion of heart, and with ſighs and groans when the prayer is uttered after a preſcript form, or read upon a Book? We grant that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> prayer
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64183:6"/> is a ſpiritual work proceeding from faith; neither is faith in any but there is ſome power to utter ſome matter of prayer in every one that prayeth in faith, and to open his mind and to pour out his deſires in ſome meaſure: and that no prayer is regarded of God unleſs it do proceed from faith. But becauſe ſome are ſo overwhelmed with ignorance, others ſo weak in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions and dull in their conceit; and ſome ſo perplexed in mind and diſturbed in their thoughts, that they cannot tell how to pray or what to utter of themſelves, therefore they need the help of a ſet form of prayer preſcribed by another, or may joyn with another in a form that is read upon a Book. Yet when we pray thus by a Book; we do not fetch the matter from the Book, but from our hearts with ſighs and groans, only we are helped by a Book as the Congregarion which prayeth with the Miniſter is helped and ſtirred up by the Miniſter for the manner of delivery of their prayers unto God; Chriſt himſelf appointed a ſet form, ſaying, not when you meditate, but when you pray, ſay thus, &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 1, 2.</p>

We may farther adde this, that in ſinging of Pſalms we cannot but confeſs, They did read them upon a Book and did ſing them to the Lord, and many of thoſe Pſalms are full of Petitions and Prayers, as is evident to all men. Theſe forms were firſt ſet up and are ſtill continued for Order and Uniformity, to avoid offences and inconveniencies which then did and ſtill may ariſe in the Church; neither doth it maintain an idle Miniſtry. Our Miniſters have liberty not only in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, but in publick, both before and after their Sermons to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe their gift of prayer, and to enlarge themſelves upon any emergent occaſion or opportunity afforded; as God ſhall
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64183:6"/> enable them, and they themſelves ſhall judge fit, or any way expedient and needful: Beſides, in all the Reformed Churches they have a Liturgy, and yet have able Miniſters. Again, if Read prayers and Impoſed Liturgies be Idolatry, where ſhall we find a viſible Church? For all Churches that are and have been for many hundred years, have had Liturgies, either Impoſed or Allowed; yet not branded with Idolatry, Superſtition, or any ſuch reproachful terms.</p>

Now no man can deny but ſome things are neceſſary to be prayed for at all times, and for all perſons; as the confeſſion of our ſins and prayer for the forgiveneſs of them: For the acceptance of our perſons and prayers, for our protection from danger, for peace, for grace to live well accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Gods Laws, and the like. Of theſe there may be a ſet form preſcribed and uſed in the Church; ſome things again are not neceſſary at all times; theſe are not required but at ſpecial times and occaſions to be uſed, as the particular neceſſities of the time require; as in time of War, for Peace and deliverance from our Enemies, prayers in the time of Dearths <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

If there were in all a perfection of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and faith, a quickneſs of conceit, and a full freedom and

The old Rule is good here, <hi>Qui hene diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guit, bene doc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t;</hi> It is the part of a Wiſe-man to diſtinguiſh things, to put a difference between things, and not to confound and put together things that differ: Therefore we ſhould right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know what Popery is. Popery is properly the Errours, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes, Corruptions, Superſtitions, Idolatries, and Abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which are uſed and mantained by the Pope, Papiſts, and Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> either in Doctrine or Worſhip.</p>
               <p>Theſe indeed may properly and truly be called and account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Popery; if we ſubmit our ſelves to the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his Laws, his Doctrine, his Worſhip; if we cleave to his Adherents, to them that worſhip him and receive his Mark; if we maintain or profeſs either thoſe falſe Doctrines, or that Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious or Idolatrous worſhip which is profeſſed among them and maintained by them: Then indeed we may be rightly
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64183:7"/> ſaid to fall into Popery, and to incline unto i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>; but if we call all thoſe truths which they have, and are kept ſound among them in matters of Doctrine; or thoſe things which in matter of Worſhip are good, and pure, and free from corruption, by the name of Popery, we are very much miſtaken. If we muſt make uſe of nothing in the Service and Worſhip of God which they uſe, nor may have liberty to aſſume to our ſelves the right uſe of thoſe things which they do or have abuſed (being purged from their corruptions) we muſt then leave and renounce the Scriptures, both the Old and New Teſtament, both Baptiſm and the Supper of the Lord; yea, renounce all the Ordinances of God, pull down our Churches, and abandon all Religion. Now it is known to the world, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth the uſurped power of the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> and doth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim all his Religion and Laws, all Errours, Hereſies, Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Idolatries, and Abominations of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> ſo that no man can accuſe her unjuſtly of Popery, or brand her with the name of Popery, ſeeing ſhe hath made a full Separation from the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> And though ſhe maketh uſe of ſome things which they uſe in the Service and Worſhip of God, yet they are ſuch things as are lawful in themſelves, and fully purged from their Corruptions and Superſtitions, and cannot juſtly be accounted or called Popery. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was once a true and ſound Church, though we profeſs no perfection in the world, and not ſo pure but might be tainted with ſome Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; and was famous for the profeſſion of the true Faith and Doctrine of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 8. Their Faith was ſpoken of throughout the whole world; and as for her Biſhops, they were godly men (moſt of them being Martyrs) for three hundred years after Chriſt and more; yet ſhe was never accounted the Catholick or Univerſal Church, but a Member of the Catholick or Univerſal Church. But as time doth corrupt all things, ſo ſhe by degrees fell into corruption; The Church of <hi>England</hi> even in the time of Popery was a Member of the Catholick or Univerſal Church, and had not the being of a Church of Chriſt from <hi>Rome,</hi> or by ſeparating her ſelf from <hi>Rome,</hi> but having her eyes opened to ſee her Errours, and her Spirits quickned and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64183:8"/> ſhe began to think upon a neceſſity of Reformation, and ſo caſt off the yoak of Anti-chriſt and the uſurped power of the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> with all his Errours, Superſtitions, and Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſought to bring her Children to the right Faith of Chriſt, and to the true and pure Worſhip and Service of God. And examining the Liturgy and Book of Common<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Prayer then in uſe, and finding it corrupted and fallen from the ancient pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, ſhe compoſed a new one of her own; and though perhaps in ſome things it might not be much diſagreeing from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, yet ſeeing thoſe things were pure and ſound, free from corruption; and after the ancient Form of Liturgies of the Church, ſhe thought good to retain them, and to continue them for her uſe.</p>
               <p>We do acknowledge our Liturgy and Book of Common-Prayer to be the work of man; and as by man it was firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, ſo by man it may be at any time altered or put down; and there is no work of man ſo perfect, though never ſo abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and compleat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but may have ſome Errour in it, or be taint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſome Corruption. But that it is Popiſh, Superſtitious, Idolatrous, or Anti-chriſtian, as ſome (who had more Zeal then Knowledge) have been bold to defame it, ſavoureth of too much Ignorance, Pride Raſhneſs, and Preſumption. This we altogether deny; and the very Ordinance of Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons which did put down this Book of Common-Prayer (as you may ſee in the Preface to the Directory) did not accuſe it of any ſuch matter as Superſtition, or Idolatry; no, nor ſo much as of Errour, but ſpeaketh reverently of the firſt Compoſers of it, and modeſtly and diſcreetly of the Book it ſelf; onely they alledge this, that they found by experience that it proved an offence to many at home and abroad, diſquieted many mens Conſciences, of Miniſters and others; was too much heightned by the Prelates, made as it were an Idol by many ignorant people, was a means to hearten Papiſts, and to nouriſh an idle Miniſtry; therefore did agree and reſolve to put it down, and to ſet up the Directory in its room. Though it be granted, that ſome things in this our Book do agree with theirs (not ſo much perhaps as ſome imagine and give out) yet if we do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64183:8"/> that <hi>Rome</hi> was once a true and ſound Church, we cannot but ſuppoſe her Doctrine and Worſhip (Then) to be ſound and pure, although ſince it hath been corrupted, if then upon our Reeformation (for we did not make a new Church, but only reformed the Errours of the old) our prudent Reformers did take ſuch things as were good and pure after the ancient Form of the Liturgies of the Church, which they had corrupted with Errours (being purged and refined) for their uſe, what juſt cauſe have we to complain? The abuſe of a thing doth not aboliſh or take away the Right uſe of it; that were (as the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then ſaid) to take the Sun out of Heaven, that hath been wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped and abuſed. There is no Creature made by God, or thing uſed and made by man, but hath been ſome way wronged or abuſed. They were Wiſe-men and godly men who did at firſt make and compoſe this Book of Common-Prayer, ſome of the chiefeſt of them being Martyrs and burned in Queen <hi>Marys</hi> days for the Profeſſion of our Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and maintaining of this Book; Arch-Biſhop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Ridley, Latymer,</hi> and others; ſo that whatſoever they did in compoſing and ſetting of this Book, is to be preſumed to be done upon good grounds, and with great wiſdom and diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; If we conſider of their times and the neceſſities which lay upon them, the chief Grounds and Reaſons may be conjectured to be theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They might make uſe of ſome of the old which was anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, good, and ſound, and purged from their corruptions, that their Adverſaries might ſee that they did not make a Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Liturgy from any Love to Novelty, or out of any fond Affection of ſingularity; but that they did it only in a ſtrong zeal to the glory of God and love to the truth, and therefore did and would joyn with them wherein they could. And that all the world might take notice that they diſſented from them in nothing, but in that wherein they themſelves were now fallen from the ancient Purity, and diſſented from the truth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They found that the people were then generally Popiſhly affected, unwilling to leave their old Religion and their old Service; therefore to prevent Tumults, and ſtop Inſurrections,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64183:9"/> they might come as near the old Form as they could. Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Religions (beſides the change of Princes) do cauſe many times great troubles in States and Kingdoms; and our own Chronicles will tell you if you examine them, that the alteration of Religion with other occurrences at this time cauſed great Commotions and Inſurrections in divers places of this our Kingdom; the Land was much imbroyled at that time with Forraign Wars without the Realm abroad, as well as Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions and Inſurrections at home within the Realm.

Rebells; the chif ſtirrers of it were <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler</hi> and <hi>Dale:</hi> There were troubles in other parts, but the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt of all was the Rebellion of the <hi>Devon-ſhire</hi> and <hi>Corniſh-men;</hi> there were gathered together to the number of 10000. Rebels who grew very ſtrong and high: they twice burnt the Gates of the City of <hi>Exeter,</hi> but ſtill had the repulſe with loſs: They ſent up their Articles to the King and Council what they did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. The ſubſtance of all was, that their old Religion might be reſtored and old Service. The ſix Articles of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight ſet up, called the bloudy Articles, by ſome the whip with ſix ſtrings or coards. The King ſent his anſwer to them, which is yet extant in the Monuments of our Church, and tells them
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64183:9"/> therein rather in policy (as ſome think) then otherwiſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent them, to ſtop their Rage and ſtay their furious attempts, ſaying, the Service in the Engliſh Tongue perchance ſeemeth to you a new Service, whereas it is none other but the old. The ſelf ſame words in Engliſh, which were in Latnie, ſaving, few things taken out, ſo fond that it had been a ſhame to have heard them in Engliſh; if it were good in Latine it is good in Engliſh; it is meant for your good, to let you underſtand what is ſaid for you, to the intent you may further it with your own Devotion. Againſt this Seditious Company was ſent, Sir <hi>John Ruſſel</hi> Knight, Lord Privy Seal, as Lieutenant General of the Kings Army; who through the gracious aſſiſtance of Gods help, though in number not equally furniſhed to the other, gave them the repulſe in the Battel; who notwithſtanding being obſtinately bent, encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred with him the ſecond time, having recovered themſelves af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the firſt Battel, but then were all clean overthrown: They did what they could to quiet the people and ſtay Commotions as here you ſee.

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64183:10"/> of ſeveral offices, that the people might learn it in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh and underſtand it; yea, at firſt upon the Reformation, the Miniſter was commanded every Holy-day when there was no Sermon, immediately after the reading of the Goſpel to go up into the Pulpit, and there to read diſtinctly the Lords Prayer, the Creed, and the ten Commandments in Engliſh, and to perſwade the people to learn them, and to labour to underſtand them; and not only to learn them themſelves, but to teach them to their Children and Servants, and to bring them to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of them. They appointed the people alſo to ſay the Anſwers with the Clerk, to encourage them and draw them on to joyn with the Miniſter in thoſe prayers of the Church, that they might know that thoſe prayers were not the prayers of the Miniſter alone, but they were Coommon-prayers, their prayers, the prayers of the whole Congregation; the Miniſter was but their mouth to utter them as their Servant; they were all to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond him and joyn with him with their Voices and Mouths; or at leaſt with their hearts, following and ſealing them with the true Devotion of their hearts, and ſaying <hi>(Amen)</hi> to all.

Now we confeſs if we look upon the generality of our people of theſe times (though ſome be blind and ignorant enough) we have generally more Light of knowledge then our fore-Fathers had, becauſe we have more plenty of the means of knowledge; we have the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures open in our own Tongue to be read by every one that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can or will read, which before were kept from the common people; we have Divine Service read alſo in our Engliſh Tongue, which before was all in Latine: Then we have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Preaching, Teaching, Catechiſing, to bring the people to knowledge, ſo that we have more Brain-knowledge for Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe then our fore-Fathers had.

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64183:11"/> Examinations, Diſputations, and eſpecially their Godly and Divine Letters, you cannot but ſee how full they were of Light, of Light of the ſpirit, of knowledge, of zeal, of grace, of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and all ſpiritual Gifts. You ſhall there find how roundly and reſolutely Mr. <hi>Philpot</hi> replyed upon Doctor <hi>Morgan,</hi> Thou art not able to anſwer the Spirit of God which ſpeaketh in me for the defence of his true Religion; I am able by the might thereof to drive thee round about this Gallery before me. We have little cauſe (if we compare with them) to brag of our Light, as if we had more Light of knowledge, or more Light of grace then they had, but may remember the old Proverb, Young Folks and Children think their Fathers to be Fools, but their Fathers know them to be Fools; As for thoſe who are En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſts, pretending to immediate Revelations, and depending wholly upon the Light and Guidance of the Spirit, neglecting and deſpiſing the means which God hath appointed us; we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but account them either meer Fancies, or the Deluſions of the Devil.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whereas it is pretended that many take offence at this Book; We know there is <hi>Scandalum Datum</hi> and <hi>Scandalum Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptum,</hi> an Offence given and an Offence taken: Many take an offence where no juſt cauſe, where no juſt occaſion of offence is given. The Jews, Scribes, and Phariſees often took offence at our Saviour Chriſt (as we find in the Goſpel) at his Words, at his Works, at his Doctrine, at his Miracles; yea, at his Life and Converſation, that he was a Glutton, a Wine-bibber, a friend to Publicans and Sinners; yet no juſt cauſe of offence was given by him. Some are ſo nice and curious, ſo fantaſtick, and ſelf-conceited in theſe days, that they take offence at every thing; yea, at nothing, things of no Concernment, as the Bull is offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with a Red colour; the fault is not in the things, but in themſelves. But for thoſe things which were excepted againſt as offenſive in the Book of Common-prayer, being moſt of them Words, Phraſes of Speeches, wrong Tranſlations, or ſomewhat hard expreſſions: They are all or moſt of them (eſpecially ſuch as gave any ſeeming ground of juſt exception) are Altered, Corrected, or Expung'd in this our new Book of Common-prayer
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64183:11"/> to give ſatisfaction. But to put down this Book and ſet up a new Form, they did not think fit; and conſiderable Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may be given for it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If they ſhould put down this Book, when as no man can alledge that there is any thing in it Repugnant or contrary to the Word of God, nor any neceſſity requiring it; it muſt needs be accounted a great diſparagement to the Wiſdom and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our firſt prudent Reformers of this our Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, who were counted Learned, Godly, and Wiſe-men; took a great deal of pains and care to compoſe it, and ſetled it (as they thought) with a great deal of Wiſdom and Diſcretion; yea, gave their Lives to the Fire to maintain it. We have great cauſe not only to Honour them, but to preſerve their Credit and Eſteem, becauſe a part of the Credit of our Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion dependeth upon their Credit; ye know what odious and Reproachful terms ſome brand our Religion with, and therein blaſt the Credit of our Reformers alſo. The Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons who did put down this Book of Common prayer, yet were ſo tender of the Honour of our firſt Reformers, that in their Preface to the Directory (which is to be ſeen by all) they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to the World that they did it not from any love to Novelty or intention to diſcourage our firſt Reformers; whom we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge (ſay they) as excellent inſtruments raiſed by God to be in the purging and building of his Houſe, and deſire to be had of his and our Poſterity in everlaſting remembrance with thankfulneſs and Honour. Now what tribute of thankfulneſs and Honour ſhall we give them, if (no juſt cauſe requiring it) we ſlight, deſpiſe, and reject this their Work which they Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed with ſo much pains, induſtry, care, wiſdom, and diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on went through ſo many difficulties and dangers to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs it; yea, gave up their Lives to the Fire to Defend i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. The putting down of this Book would alſo call in queſtion the Wiſdom and Gravity of all our Parliaments, which have been theſe hundred years which have not only paſſed it over and conſented to it, but Eſtabliſhed it; and again and again Confirmed it by Law. Our Parliament is the great Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64183:12"/> of our Land and Kingdom, made up of the moſt Learned, moſt Wiſe, moſt Godly, and choiceſt men of the Realm: And if this Book were ſo Erroneous, Superſtitious, or Idolatrous as ſome defame it, ſurely we cannot conceive but ſome of them would have ſeen and obſerved thoſe Errours, and moved to have had it ſome way changed or altered in ſo many years: ſeeing they are as much concerned in it as any, and their duty doth much lie upon it to ſee our Religion pure; the putting down then of it now upon ſuch an account could not but be a great blemiſh to them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This would alſo prejudice and wrong not only the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Wiſdom, but the Integrity, Sincerity, and Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs of all our Godly and Grave Divines, who have lived and been in <hi>England</hi> ſince the firſt Reformation of this our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion; who have not only ſubmited to it, but have ſubſcribed to it as lawful and not contrary to the Word of God. Were all blind, and have led the blind all this time, and could not ſee ſuch groſs Errours as are now pretended to be in it? we cannot conceive ſo hardly or uncharitably of them, but ſuppoſe they were as Learned, Wiſe, Religious, and Conſcientious as our ſelves: But if we now make a change of it upon that account, either of Errour, Superſtition, or Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; we muſt needs acknowledge and confeſs ſome great defect in them; either that they failed in knowledge, or in Conſcience, or in both, and ſo condemn them all.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Let it be granted that this Book ſhould be put down, then one of theſe two muſt needs follow; then either there muſt be no Form of Common-prayer ſet up and preſcribed, or a new Form deviſed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If there ſhould be no Form ſet up, but every man left at Liberty and have Liberty of Conſcience (as we call it) to do what is good in his our own eyes; we have ſeen too much of the fruits of that already: There is no man ſo blind but can ſee it is that Liberty of Conſcience which hath been long given and taken among us, which hath brought all theſe Errours, Schiſms, Sects, Factions, Hereſies, and Diviſions among us, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Gods mercy muſt needs end in Confuſion. Forms of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64183:12"/> prayer, of Common-prayer, were firſt ſet up and are ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nued, eſpecially to this end; to ſtop Errours, to ſtop Schiſms prevent Factions, preſerve Order, and to keep Unity and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity in the Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If a new Form ſhould be deviſed to ſatisfie the Niceneſs, Curioſity, or Scrupulouſneſs of ſome (who are never long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with one thing, but ſtill running upon change) What Form could poſſibly be invented to content all, eſpecially in theſe times wherein we are all broken and ſhattered into as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Sects, Factions, Shreds and Pieces, almoſt as be Perſons? Nothing can poſſibly be framed to ſatisfie all, and it is probable that whatſoever ſhould be deviſed would be as little or leſs ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory then this.</p>
               <p>Now upon theſe Grounds and Reaſons (as we may Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture) and many other which might be alledged, it hath been judged moſt expedient to continue this our Book of Common-prayer (being ſomewhat altered in thoſe things which were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted againſt) and to Confirm it, becauſe of the Fickleneſs of our nature who are never long content with any ſet courſe in any thing, or in any condition of Life; but ſtill greedy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of Novelty and Change, though many times the change prove for the worſe.</p>
               <p>The truth is, all men, yea Wiſe-men and Good men have their Affections, and the miſery is, that men are many time more ſwayed with their affections then ruled by judgment, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled (as they ought to be) with perfect reaſon which ſhould regulate the judgment. Some meerly out of humour and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, who never did examine this Book of Common prayer throughly with underſtanding and judgment; nay, perhaps did never ſo much as vouchſafe to read it over, unleſs it were in a Curſory way; but if they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

You may read
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64183:13"/> in the Book of Martyrs how ſtoutly he defended our Religion to the face of <hi>Stephen Gardener</hi> then Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> and Lord Chancellour, and told them plainly that he was a Revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that he had forſaken the truth, denyed our Saviour Chriſt and his Word, and done contrary to his Oath and Writing which he gave and made in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th. and <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th. and there maintained (as Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> Recordeth) Marriage of Prieſts, and the Communion againſt the Maſs, and the Papiſts Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory Sacrifice for Quick and Dead; denying Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, &amp;c. And at laſt when he was delivered over to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed to the Kings Bench, he fell down upon his knees, and lifting up both his hands, prayed, and ſaid, <hi>Good Lord I thank thee;</hi> and from the Tyranny of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> and all his deteſtable Errours, Idolatries, and Abominations, <hi>Good Lord deliver us, &amp;c.</hi> By theſe words you may ſee he was neither Papiſt not Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>later. Yet this man and Martyr, who was Doctor both of the Civil and Canon Laws, a right perfect Divine (as Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth him) who was ſo Learned, Godly, and Religious, ſtood ſo ſtoutly and ſtrongly againſt Popery, and dyed ſo conſtantly for our Religion, did not take this Book of Common-prayer then uſually called (the Sevice-book) to be Popiſh, Superſtitious, Idolatrous, or Anti-chriſtian; for (as Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> tells us) he had it conſtantly by him, and made uſe of it during all the time of his Impriſonment; And the Night after he was degraded, and ſo put over to the Secular Power, his Wife and his Son <hi>Thomas,</hi> and <hi>John Hull</hi> his Servant, came and were by the Keepers of the Kings priſon ſuffered to Sup with him. And at their coming in before Supper they all kneeled down and ſaid the Letany, which by ſome is now reputed the worſt and moſt Abominable part of all the Book of Common-prayer; beſides this, Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> there reporteth that when this Doctor <hi>Rowland Taylor</hi> was to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed away to <hi>Hadley</hi> to be burnt, and took his leave of his Wife and Son, he gave to his Wife this Book of Church Service (then ſo called) ſet out by King <hi>Edward;</hi> this Book of Common-prayer (which he alwayes uſed in his Impriſonment) as the laſt token and beſt token of his love unto her. Here you ſee the judgment of this glorious Martyr, who was the true Servant of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:64183:13"/> God, ſtood for our Religion to the Death in thoſe fiery times of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> Sealing it with his blood, how much he prized this and highly eſteemed it. To this I might adde the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Judgment of Arch-biſhop <hi>Cranmer, Latymer,</hi> and <hi>Ridley,</hi> with many more who were the makers of this Book, and content to give their Lives to the Fire to defend it and our Religion: They could not ſee, neither judge any thing in it to be Popiſh.

If we had but modeſty and the grace of humility in us, we could not but ſuſpect our own Judgment, and think we are deceived, unleſs we would be of the mind of <hi>Abelardus,</hi> ſingular and croſs to all, and ſay as he did and was wont to ſay; <hi>Omnes alii ſic, ego non ſic;</hi> All men are of this mind and judgment, but I am of another; howſoever we ſhould not reproach it or ſpeak thus Contemptuouſly of it. <hi>Si accuſaſſe ſufficia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

This Candle by Gods mercy hath burnt hitherto, and by his bleſſing (if our ſins do not hinder) may continue and never be put out again. Mr. <hi>Bagſhaw</hi> who made a ſtrong Speech in the beginning of our late Long-Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt our Biſhops, to bring them all into a Premunire for their late Canons then made, and exceeding and going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their Commiſſion according to Law, giveth this honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable teſtimony of the Martyrs who firſt ſtood for our Religion in the Commendation of <hi>Pembroke Hall</hi> in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> that <hi>William Sawtree</hi> was <hi>Martyrum Primus,</hi> Ridley <hi>Martyrum Doctiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> and <hi>Bradſord Martyrum Piiſsimus;</hi> yet all theſe ſtout Champions for the truth, who were the very Pillars to bear up our Religion, muſt be cryed up by theſe young men for Papiſts, and this Book of Common-prayer (their Work) for Popery: This cannot but ſhew a great deal of Pride and Ignorance. Had theſe men been well bred at the Schools of the Prophets, brought up at the Univerſity their full time, and tarried at <hi>Jericho</hi> till their Beards were grown, they would have had more Humility, Modeſty, Wiſdom, and Diſcretion.</p>

Theſe words indeed (at the firſt ſight or ſound of them) To be ſpoken of all indifferently, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any diſtinction, though their Lives had been never ſo bad and looſe, might ſeem ſomewhat ſtrange and harſh to many an honeſt and well-meaning man, who did not underſtand them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, or know the Grounds or Reaſons of them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If you mark the words well, it is not ſaid in ſure and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain hope of his or her Reſurrection to eternal Life, as in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Reverence to the party deceaſed; but the words are ſpoken in general In ſure and certain hope of Reſurrection to eternal life; that is, of (a) Reſurrection to eternal life, or as it is now Corrected and ſet down in the Book, in ſure and certain hope of (the) Reſurrection to eternal Life: To ſhew that we Chriſtians do believe that there is a Reſurrection to eternal life, and that we bury our dead in a ſtrong hope and faith, that we and all true believers ſhall riſe again to eternal life. In doubtful Speeches charity ſhould take the beſt conſtruction and faireſt interpretation, and not pervert the meaning of the words.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If they will not be perſwaded, but that it was meant by the Church, as they take it and will apply it in reference to the party deceaſed; yet this at moſt is but the charity of our Church, and you know what the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of charity, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. Charity thinketh no evil, believeth all things, hopeth all things, covereth a multitude of faults; we have no warrant in Scripture (as far as I find) to judge, cenſure, or condemn any man (eſpecially for his final end) though he lived never ſo looſely, he might have grace (for ought we know) to repent before his death; but rather command to the contrary, <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 37. <hi>Judge not, and you ſhall not be judged; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn not, and ye ſhall not be condemned.</hi> Again, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 4. <hi>Who art thou that condemneſt another mans Servant?</hi> He ſtandeth or fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth (ſaith the Apoſtle) to his own Maſter. And this charity is
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64183:16"/> grounded upon more Reaſon then every one underſtandeth, if we conſider the conſtitution of the Government of our Church, the ſtrictneſs of Diſcipline that was ſet up and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the temper and condition of the people of thoſe times, you will find both Reaſon and Equity in it The Government ſet up was ſtrict, if any of the Congregation were known, or upon common fame noted to be Drunkards, or any way Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, Fornicators, unclean Perſons, or any way prophane; they were to be preſented to the Court by the Church-Wardens of the Pariſh upon their Oath (which was uſually done twice a year conſtantly if not oftner) they were ſummoned and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented to the Court, and upon Proof or Evidence of the Fact cenſured and put to open penance for the terrour of others: If the party Delinquent did ſubmit, repent, and promiſe amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, upon his penace all was remitted; he was received in as a Brother, and reconciled to the Church; but if he continued ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate and wilful in his courſe, was excommunicated and caſt out of the Church, and ſo ſtood till he did repent: And being excommunicate, if he died ſo, he was not thus to be buried, but was by the Law and by the Church debarred of the priviledge called by the ancients by the name of (Chriſtian Burial) ſo that if a man were ſuch a notorious Offender and Excommunicate by the cenſure of the Church, as few ſuch were in thoſe days (peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were not ſo looſe by far as now, and again they feared much the curſe of the Church, the danger of Excommunication) he was excluded from this priviledge by the Law, and might not be thus buried by the Miniſter. Now if we look upon other forms of Government, the Presbyterians and Independents alſo will acknowledge that no private man, nor ſole and ſingle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, nor the Miniſter himſelf ſhould have power to judge, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, or condemn any man, or as much as to diſown him as a Brother for any fault till he be cenſured and condemned by the Church; this were too tyrannical: Then let any man judge (if he look upon our Diſcipline being now fully again revived, if it be fully executed as it ſhould be) whether charity be here altogether miſtaken, or what juſt ground there is given of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception againſt thoſe words. But all theſe we will paſs over
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:64183:17"/> and not mention them any farther, becauſe all of them or the moſt of them (ſuch as gave any juſt ſeeming cauſe or occaſion of offence) are amended, altered, or expunged, and put out in this our book of Common<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>prayer to give ſatisfaction</p>

Now you muſt know that the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Bible into ſeveral Sections hath much differed; it was a long time parted into Titles; for Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> 355. for Saint <hi>Mark</hi> 335. for Saint <hi>Luke</hi> 343. for Saint <hi>John</hi> 332, &amp;c. Some are of opinion that the preſent diſtinction of Chapters now generally uſed was by <hi>Lanfranck</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Anno Dom.</hi> 1060. becauſe we do not meet with it ſooner, and <hi>Rabbi Kimchi</hi> and other Learned Jews from that time uſe the ſame partition of Chapters in the old Teſtament; yet <hi>John Bale</hi> affirmeth, that <hi>Stephen Langton</hi> Arch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Bible into Chapters about <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1224.

               <p n="1">1. They are all parts and portions of Canonical Scripture, and in that regard they cannot any way be diſallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That they are ſo ordered, that the Epiſtles for the moſt part hold forth the Doctrine of Manners for the regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of our Lives, and the Goſpels the Doctrine of Faith unto the people, for the perfecting of our knowledge, and ſetling of our Judgment and Conſciences by way of belief in the great Myſteries of our Salvation, being ſelect porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons moſt fit for Edification.</p>

               <p n="4">4. This courſe hath been anciently uſed and long obſerved in the Church; <hi>Walfridus Strabo</hi> the Abbot doth aſcribe it to the firſt Succeſſors of the Apoſtles. Indeed we find in the Primitive times that they had their <hi>(Lectures)</hi> their Readers, who read the Scripture to the people in their publick Aſſemblies when they met together, but whether they read theſe, is uncertain.</p>
               <p>Some ſuppoſe St. <hi>Hierome</hi> did Collect them, and <hi>Damaſus</hi> brought them into the Church; but <hi>Hierome</hi> himſelf in his <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logetico adverſus Vigilantium,</hi> maketh mention of theſe Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Goſpel uſed in the Greek Church long before his time; others ſay it was <hi>Alcuinus</hi> the Maſter of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, and ſome <hi>Paulus Diaconus;</hi> but the beginning is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uncertain; but this the moſt affirm, that this courſe hath been uſed in the Church twelve hundred years and upwards: And the Reformed Churches in <hi>Germany</hi> uſe them ſtill, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them to this day.</p>
               <p>As for the Places and Texts of Scripture alledged againſt this
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:64183:18"/> courſe, they conclude nothing, neither are they of any value; we deny not but as it is <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 29. <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets are to be read, are to be heard, and as <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 15. and <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 21. they are to be read upon the Sabbath days. But there you ſee they are but Lectures, Parts, and Portions of them, not whole Books at one time; and no man can ſay but that we do or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily and uſually read them to them people. As for that <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 4. 16. we do not find that he doth command that that Epiſtle ſhould be read all at one time, though we acknowledge it is not ſo long but it might be conveniently read all at one time, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when it came firſt unto them, but only to be read of them, and in the Churches of the <hi>Laodiceans;</hi> And for that of 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. we confeſs, that the whole Scripture is given by Inſpiration of God, and is profitable to teach, to convince, to correct, and to inſtruct in righteouſneſs. But withall no man can deny but one part of the Scripture may be far more Edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, far more profitable for the people then another. Then what are all theſe Texts to the purpoſe? we find in the ancient Records, that the Jews in Gods ancient Church had their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Sections, Parts, and Portions of Scripture (which they called <hi>Paraſchioth)</hi> diſtinct parcels ſet out to be read on the Sabbath days, which St. <hi>Luke</hi> calleth Lectures, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 15.

And in the Primitive times we do not find that they were tied either to read or to expound upon one Book wholly, and go through it all along in order; but took parts and portions of Scripture, ſuch as they accounted moſt uſeful and profitable for the people, moſt Edifying, and alſo moſt proper for the time; which they did not only read but expound and preach upon, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially theſe ſelect Epiſtles and Goſpels, as may plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to any man by the many and ſeveral Poſtills which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant upon them.</p>

               <p n="1">1.

And ſurely we muſt needs think and judge, though the bodies of the people be there preſent, yet if their hearts (if not their lips) do not joyn with him, thoſe prayers which he maketh and there poureth out (being their prayers and in their behalf) cannot be ſaid to be the prayers of the people, or any way effectual for them, or acceptable to God from them (but rather accounted by God a deluſion in them) ſeeing he is but their Mouth, their Speaker, to deliver and preſent their Petitions to God, to utter them for the people and in their behalf. It is a great miſtake in people to think that in the Common-prayers of the Church the Miniſter can do all their duty to God for them without them; They muſt conſider they come not to the Church (the Houſe of prayer) to hear the Miniſter pray, but to pray them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to joyn their hearts (if not their voices) with the Miniſter in the Common-prayers of the Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2 You muſt alſo take notice that this is Common-prayer wherein all ſhould joyn and unite their hearts together (if not their voices) in their joynt and common Supplications unto God, that they may the better prevail with God; the whole Congregation ſhould agree and joyn with the Miniſter in them, as the Apoſtle ſheweth in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 16. where ſpeaking of him that prayed in the Church with a ſtrange tongue, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the people, he ſaith, <hi>How ſhall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned ſay</hi> (Amen) <hi>at thy giving of thanks, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he knoweth not what thou ſayeſt?</hi> whereby it appeareth that at that time it was the cuſtom of the Church.

For the night before <hi>Peter</hi> was to be brought forth, he ſent his Angel into the priſon, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Peter</hi> being aſleep, bound with two chains and lying between two Souldiers, cauſed his chains to fall off, opened unto him the priſon doors, went before him, led him out into the City, and ſo delivered him out of the hand of <hi>Herod</hi> and from the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of the people. Thus you ſee the power of Common-prayer, how much it prevaileth with God when the true ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God joyn bands and unite themſelves together in prayer, beſeeching God for any ſpecial bleſſing; remember well what is written, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 24. when <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> being threatned by the Prieſts and Elders, and commanded to teach no more in the name of Jeſus, came to their fellows and ſhewed them what had been done unto them, it is recorded when they heard it, they lift up their voices with one accord, and ſaid, <hi>O Lord thou art the God, &amp;c.</hi> And that God was well pleaſed with the lifting up of their voices together with their hearts in prayer, may appear by <hi>ver.</hi> 31. and when as they prayed, the place was ſhaken where they were aſſembled together, and they were all filled with the Holy Ghoſt, and they ſpake the word of God boldly. What are our words and voices but the Expreſtions and Interpretations of our hearts? then why may not our people joyn their voices as well as their hearts (eſpecially at ſome times) with the Miniſter, to ſtir up themſelves, and expreſs their Devotion, and to ſhew that they own the prayers of the Miniſter, and do joyn with him in the Common-prayers of the Church?</p>

Conſider the Reaſons why the Clerk is ſometimes to ſay after the Miniſter, as in the confeſſion of Sins, the Lords prayer, &amp;c. and why at other times to anſwer the Miniſter. We may think that Wiſe men and Godly men would ordain nothing in the Church without good Reaſons and Ground for it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the Clerk, you muſt know he is only appointed to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer as the Guide and Leader of the people and Congregation, to draw them on and to encourage them to follow him; for what he ſays, all ſhould ſay with him in the confeſſion of ſins, the Lords prayer, in the Letany, repeating of the ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or elſewhere; yea all, Miniſter, Clerk, and Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould joyn with their hearts (and may ſometimes with their voices) is all the prayers of the Church, for Deliverance, for Mercy, for Grace, for Peace, &amp;c. what is uttered by one, ſhould be ſeconded with the Mouths, or at leaſt with the hearts of all the Congregation, eſpecially in ſaying (Amen) to all, becauſe all ought to joyn in the Common-prayers of the Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the people, why they ſhould joyn their hearts always with the Miniſter in the Common-prayers of the Church, and may, at ſome ſet times, their voices, theſe Reaſons may be rendred.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To ſtir them up to attention, to ſhake off their ſluggiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to keep them from ſlumbring, and to bring them to the knowledge of the ſeveral parts of Divine Service; you cannot but take notice that our common and ordinary people are not only ignorant, but very dull and lumpiſh in the performance of Divine Service: They do it without Reverence or Fear, need often ſtirring up and quickning. Many of them think it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough if they come to Church and be there with their bodies, whereſoever their hearts be; therefore ſome as ſoon as they are ſetled in their ſeats, hold down their heads and fall aſleep; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers gaze about, and ſome are ſlugging and ſlumbring, little minding the Service of God, ſo that they need quickning and ſtirring up. Now if they would joyn and ſay with the Clerk (as they ought) it would be a means to put life into them, to ſhake off drowſineſs, to raiſe up their attention and Devotion, to mind them of the buſineſs they are about, and to bring them
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:64183:20"/> to ſome meaſure of Knowledge and Underſtanding.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To make them know that the prayers there uttered by the Miniſter are their prayers made in their name, for them and in their behalf, that they ſhould own them, go along in their hearts (if not always in their voices) with their Miniſter, and ſaying (Amen) to all, that it may appear that they underſtand what they do, and not only give their conſent, but do joyn along with him in the Common-prayers of the Church; ſo that no man can juſtly take offence at the Clerks anſwering, but ſuch as underſtand not the true grounds and reaſons of it.</p>

It is not as ſome imagine (ſaith an ancient Father) that long praying is that fault of much ſpeaking in prayer, which our Saviour doth there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, for then he would not himſelf have continued whole nights in prayer, as you read <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 12. <hi>that he ſpent the whole night in prayer to God;</hi> but that we ſhould uſe no vain ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity of words as the heathens do, no vain Tautologies, for they imagine that their much ſpeaking will cauſe them to be heard; whereas in truth the thing which God looketh upon, is how well our hearts are affected in prayer, and not how copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous our tongues are, how well we are affected in the true devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our hearts when we come to preſent our Supplications before him, and not how long we talk.

Look upon the Parable of the Phariſee and Publican mentioned by our Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 10. Two men went up to the Temple to pray, the one a Phariſee, the other a Publican; the Phariſee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a long prayer juſtifying himſelf, laying open and cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the faults and ſins of others, and condemning the poor Publican. ☉ <hi>God, I thank thee that I am not as other men, Extortio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Unjuſt, Adulterers, or as this Publican; I faſt twice in the week, I give tithe of all that ever I poſſeſſe.</hi> Here you ſee how he doth inlarge and commend himſelf; but the Publican ſtood a far off, and would not lift ſo much as his eyes up to Heaven, as being aſhamed of his ſins, confounded in himſelf, and afraid of Gods judgments; but ſmote his breaſt to ſhew the true contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his heart; his prayer is ſhort, only this, <hi>O God, be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to me a ſinner;</hi> yet this man went home to his houſe juſtified (ſaith our Saviour) rather then the other; God accepted of the ſhort prayer of the humble Publican proceeding from faith, and rejected the long prayer of the proud Phariſee.

Mark the prayer of <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 13. when ſhe prayed in Gods Houſe for a Son,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:64183:21"/> the Text ſaith, ſhe ſpake in her heart, her lips did only move, her voice was not heard; ſo that <hi>Eli</hi> the Prieſt took her to be drunk, but ſhe anſwered, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. 16. <hi>Nay my Lord, but I am a woman troubled in ſpirit, I have drunk neither wine nor ſtrong drink, but have poured out my ſoul before God; for of the abundance of my complaint and of my grief have I ſpoken hitherto.</hi> God heard in Heaven the very groans and deſire of her heart, and gave her a Son according to her deſire.

Now our prayers are Common-prayer, fitted for the capacity of our plain, common, and ordinary peope, whoſe hearts cannot be long bent fully to one thing, but are apt to ſtray; therefore our prayers are ſhort, to keep up the Attention of the heart and ſpirit, and many becauſe they conſiſt of many ſeveral Petitions and Requeſts. If we look upon Antiquity, St. <hi>Auguſtine Ep.</hi> 121. tells us, that the Brethren in <hi>Egypt</hi> are reported to have many prayers, but every one of them very ſhort, as if they were darts thrown out with a kind of ſudain quickneſs, leaſt the vigilant and erect attention of the mind which in prayer is very neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, ſhould be waſted and dulled, if their prayers were few and long. And <hi>Luther</hi> ſaith, that prayer is <hi>Chriſtianorum Bombarda,</hi> the Chriſtians Gun-ſhot; as then a Bullet out of a Gun, ſo prayers out of our mouth can go no farther then the ſpirit doth carry them: Therefore it is humble and fervent Devotion, the ſtrong bent of the heart, mind, and ſpirit that doth pierce the gates of Heaven and pleaſeth God, as you may ſee by <hi>Hannah,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 13. and the ſhort Ejaculations of an earneſt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout ſoul are a loud cry in the ears of God, as you may perceive by Gods words to <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 14. 15. <hi>Why doſt thou cry unto me?</hi>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:64183:22"/> ſo that if our prayers be ſhort and many, as conſiſting of many ſeveral Petitions, as long as our hearts and the fervency of the Spirit are joyned with them, there is no doubt but they may and ſhall find acceptance with God.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Now the uſual Geſture among us in time of prayer is either ſtanding or kneeling; we do not altogether diſallow of ſtanding in prayer, but we may ſtand as a ſervant before his Maſter, or as a ſubject before his Prince; we may kneel upon our knees; St. <hi>Stephen</hi> (as we may ſuppoſe) uſed both theſe Geſtures; pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for himſelf, we may conjecture he prayed ſtanding. <hi>Act.</hi> 7. 59. it is ſaid they ſtoned <hi>Stephen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p n="1">1. To ſtir up the dulneſs and ſluggiſhneſs of people, and to keep them from ſlumbring and ſleeping, and to ſtir up their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to conſider of the ſeveral parts of the Service of God. Common people are very dull and lumpiſh, and many times very drowſie in the performance of the Service of God, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſate long in hearing the Pſalms read unto them, and the Chapters read, are many times overtaken with ſlumbring and drowſineſs; and this ſtanding up then at the rehearſal of the Creed may be a good means to cauſe them to ſhake off their drowſineſs, to keep them from ſlumbring, and to quicken their attention to the Service they are about. If there were nothing elſe, this might (in ſome mens judgments) be a ſufficient ground for this injunction as long as the Geſture is indifferent in it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:64183:23"/> 2. This ſtanding up at the Creed (the Confeſſion of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith) may be required to teach blind and ignorant peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to inform them that the Creed is no prayer. There be too many ignorant people (notwithſtanding the great Light we have, and the plentiful means of inſtruction by continual Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Teaching, and Catechiſing) here among us, yet ſtill take this Creed to be a prayer (which formerly by moſt was account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among their prayers, and ſo uſed by them as a prayer) Now becauſe ordinarily in our prayers we do kneel as is fitting and we are required; This very poſture of ſtanding up at the rehearſal of this Creed, may convince them fully that it is no prayer, but a publick Confeſſion and Profeſſion of our Chriſtian Faith.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The chief reaſon at all why we ſtand up at the rehearſal of this the Apoſtles Creed, is to ſhew our Chriſtian reſolution, to maintain and defend this our Chriſtian Doctrine. For this Creed is a ſhort abridgment and Epitome of all the Apoſtles Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which they received from Chriſt our Saviour, and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to us in the New Teſtament. The rule of our Faith, the Touch-ſtone of Truth, the very Pith and Subſtance of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, the very Badge and Cogniſance of a Chriſtian; whereby he is not only known from Pagans, but diſtinguiſhed from Hereticks: Therefore we are injoyned not only to ſtand up at the rehearſal of it, but to joyn our ſelves alſo in rehearſing it, to teſtifie to the world our readineſs and conſtancy to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this our Religion and Profeſſion (being the true Catholick Faith whereof this is a full abridgment) that we are willing to ſtand to it to the death, and to live and die in the Profeſſion of it.</p>

Bowing at the Name of the Lord Jeſus, this indeed is alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; that as all perſons ſhould reverently kneel upon their knees when the general Confeſſion and other prayers were made, ſtand up at the ſaying of the Creed and Belief, ſo when in the time of Divine Service the Lord Jeſus ſhould be mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, due and lowly reverence ſhould be done by all perſons pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, teſtifying by theſe outward Ceremonies and Geſture, their inward humility, Chriſtian Reſolution, and due acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the true and eternal Son
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:64183:24" rendition="simple:additions"/> of God is the only Saviour of the world, in whom alone all the Mercies, Graces, and Promiſes of God to mankind for this life, and the life to come are fully &amp; wholly compriſed according to that of S. <hi>Peter, Act.</hi> 4. 12. <hi>Neither is there Salvation in any other; for among men there is given none other Name under heaven whereby we muſt be ſaved:</hi> Though all do not agree that this bowing is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther commanded in thoſe words of the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2 10. <hi>That at the Name of Jeſus every knee ſhall bow, of things in heaven, things in earth, and things under the earth.</hi> Nor that it can be by any ſtrong and undeniable Argument drawn from them, becauſe they conceive that the Apoſtle doth not mean or intend thoſe words of the outward knees of the Body, ſeeing Angels and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils have no bodily knees: But his meaning is, that all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in Heaven and Earth, and under the Earth ſhall acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him to be their Lord; ſhall honour, worſhip him, obey him, and give him the Glory that is due unto him: yet we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think that any reaſonable underſtanding man can judge it altogether unlawful, either to uncover the head or bow the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy at the naming of the Lord Jeſus, to ſhew the reverence that is due unto him, ſo that the inward intention of the Mind and Devotion of the Heart be joyned, and go along with the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Geſture of the Body; but the fear is, that God may complain in this of many, as he did of the Jews; <hi>Eſ.</hi> 29. 13. <hi>They come near me with their lips, and honour me with their mouths; but their hearts are far from me.</hi> So many honour the Name of the Lord Jeſus formally in a complemental outward way of Cap and Knee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who regard him not in their hearts, nor make any Conſcience to live up unto him in their lives; yet again, we muſt conſider that this is our fault, the fault of men and their corruption, not the fault of the Ceremony. And we may alſo conceive that it was the Wiſdom of the Church, when it ſaw how dead, dull, and lumpiſh, nay ſtupid common people are in Divine Service, to appoint this Ceremony to ſtir up people, ſhake off their ſluggiſhneſs, raiſe up their Devotion, and quicken their attention to the hearing of the Word of God Read or Preached, leaſt they ſhould be overcome of drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, and ſo if rightly uſed, it might be a good means
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:64183:24"/> to help us to amend that fault, and to quicken our attention.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay why ſhould we give more honour to the Son then to the Father? to the Name of the Lord Jeſus then to the God, who is the Father?</p>
               <p>To this we may anſwer, he that honoureth the Son, honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Father; we do not thereby deny any honour that is due unto the Father, or rob God the Father of his honour; but we do honour God the Father in his Son, acknowledging the great love and wonderful mercies of God the Father unto Mankind ſealed up in the Lord Jeſus his Son for the Redemption of the world, according to that of our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 5. 23. all men ſhould honour the Son as they honour the Father; <hi>He that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureth not the Son, the ſame honoureth not the Father which hath ſent him;</hi> ſo that thereby we do not deprive God the Father of the honour due unto him, but rather add to his honour inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the Lord Jeſus all the mercies and graces of God the Father which are conveyed unto us by his Son, and ſealed up unto us in the Lord Jeſus his Son. But you will ſay, We deſire to know ſome Reaſon for it, why we ſhould give more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the Name of the Lord Jeſus then to the Name of God the Father.</p>
               <p>Theſe Grounds and Reaſons may not unfitly be given.</p>

There is no Nation in the world but doth acknowledge God; <hi>Nulla Natio tam barbara, Nulla Gens tam Efferata, cui non infideat haec Opinio Deum eſſe,</hi> could <hi>Tully</hi> an heathen man ſay that there is no Nation in the world ſo barbarous, but doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge God and worſhip God or ſomewhat inſtead of God.

               <p n="3">3. The work of our Redemption is a more beneficial work to us then the work of our Creation. It is true, that at the firſt God made man a glorious creature after his own image in righteouſneſs and true holineſs, indued him with many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, and gave him power over all creatures, but yet made him mutable and ſo mortal, ſubject to death, if he broke the Covenant. And man by his diſobedience did break the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, ſo plunged himſelf and his Poſterity into all kind of eternal miſeries, had not the Lord Jeſus come to ſave us and redeem us. Then in this regard alſo ſeeing the Lord Jeſus did indure thoſe bitter torments to redeem us and to ſave us from the curſe and wrath of God, and all thoſe miſeries wherein by the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> we were plunged, and were brought into ſuch an eſtate of miſery, as without the mercy and merites of the Lord Jeſus in working our Redemption, it had been happy for

               <p n="4">4.

               <p n="5">5. Kneeling at the receiving of the Lords Supper; this hath been an ancient cuſtom in our Church, neither can I conceive how any moderate-minded man can judge it any way unlawful or unfitting at that time to humble our ſelves to the very duſt, and to kneel upon our knees at ſuch a time when we come to acknowledge our unworthineſs, to confeſs our ſins and bewail them with hearty ſorrow, whereby we have offended God; to beg pardon of him and reconcilement by the merits of the Lord Jeſus, to gain again the favour and mercy of God held out unto us by his golden Scepter in the merits and mediation of his Son and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt at the receiving of this bleſſed
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:64183:26"/> Sacrament, the remembrance whereof we do there celebrate and receive thoſe bleſſed myſteries. To confirm our faith and to give us an aſſurance of the performance of all the promiſes of mercy made unto us in the Lord Jeſus our alone Saviour; we cannot but judge him unworthy of pardon, who having offended his Prince and juſtly deſerved puniſhment, ſhall be ſo high or unthankful that he refuſeth to receive his pardon upon his knees.</p>
               <p>There have indeed formerly been differences raiſed in the Church about this geſture; yet thoſe who were againſt kneeling could never agree what geſture to have. Some would have it to be taken ſtanding, ſome would have this Sacrament to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſitting, ſome again leaning with their body: theſe be poor Punctilio's to ſtand upon, for a wiſe man to make difference in the Church, a Schiſm and a Rent upon ſo ſmall an occaſion. The moſt men who are moderate, count the geſture and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of our bodies at and in the receiving of this holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be a thing meerly indifferent, ſo we come with true faith and repentance and our hearts be every way rightly affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with reverence to this Service, as we ought to be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, whether we ſit, ſtand, lean, or kneel; but it muſt needs be acknowledged that kneeling is the moſt reverent and moſt humble poſture of them all; and humility is a great ornament in a Chriſtian. But the moſt in theſe late times of liberty have pleaded for and uſed (ſitting) at the receiving of this holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, pretending that it is a Communion whereby we have a fellowſhip with our Saviour Chriſt, &amp; a fellowſhip among our ſelves. And that it cometh neareſt to that geſture which was uſed by our Saviour Chriſt himſelf at the firſt inſtitution of it, we cannot deny but it is a Communion whereby we have a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with Chriſt our Saviour, and a fellowſhip among our ſelves, but we cannot think that it is ſuch a fellowſhip as to ſit (as we ſay) Cheek by Jole with Chriſt at his Table, to keep no diſtance, and that he expecteth no honour or reverence at our hands.

               <p>You may reply now, why doth the Scripture ſay then in the Bible, <hi>He ſate down, &amp;c.</hi> if our Saviour Chriſt did not ſit, but leaned or lay down upon a Bed at Supper.</p>
               <p>To this we may anſwer thus.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe that kind of poſture of their Bodies at their Meals was their Table geſture, and anſwerable to our ſitting at our Tables and at our Meals.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It was thought good thus to tranſlate it, to fit the Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and Underſtanding of the common people; to make it ſuitable to them who would wonder to hear that he lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or lay down upon a Bed at Supper, and think ſtrangely of it. That which ſeemeth decent to one according to the cuſtom of times and places, many times ſeemeth uncomely to another.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe it might be ſometimes when he raiſed up himſelf to take any thing upon the Table; for the time he might be in a ſitting poſture, though he did preſently lie down again.</p>
               <p>But if it be granted that our Saviour Chriſt did ordain it ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and gave it to his Diſciples ſitting; yet we think there is no more neceſſity to tie us to follow the example of our Saviour Chriſt in this, more then there is required in any of the other circumſtances of his Inſtitution. It is certain that our Saviour Chriſt waſhed his Diſciples feet before his laſt Supper; that he did inſtitute it after Supper in unleavened bread, that he did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:64183:27"/> it in the Night or in the Evening, to Men alone and no Women; to Twelve only in number (if <hi>Judas</hi> did receive) and no more. Yet becauſe there is no precept in the Goſpel for theſe things, no Chriſtian Church at this day preciſely obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth all theſe Circumſtances, but every Church taketh liberty to it ſelf for Decency, Order, and Edification, to appoint and uſe what geſture ſhe pleaſeth. The Reformed Churches of <hi>France</hi> receive this Sacrament ſtanding, the <hi>Netherlands</hi> generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this Sacrament ſitting, we here in <hi>England</hi> are to receive it kneeling.</p>
               <p>But ſome do object, to kneel at the receiving of the Lords Supper is <hi>Arto-Latrie,</hi> a worſhipping of the Bread, yea Idolatry and Superſtition.</p>
               <p>We anſwer. Many Ignorant, Raſh, and Self conceited peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are too forward to exclaim againſt the ancient Rites and Cuſtoms of our Church (becauſe they do not underſtand the Grounds and Reaſons of them) as Popiſh, Idolatrous, and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious; yea ſome (though themſelves know not rightly what Popery, Idolatry, or Superſtition is) yet if they can blaſt and but ſtigmatize any ancient Cuſtom with any of theſe terms (though never ſo unjuſtly) they think they have done enough, they have won the field. The old Proverb is true in theſe, if in any, <hi>Scientia non habet inimicum niſi ignorantem;</hi> there is not a greater enemy to Knowledge then an ignorant man. If theſe men had Learning and Knowledge, and read Antiquity, and did rightly examine the Grounds of old Cuſtoms, they would be wiſer then they are, and not ſo raſh in Judging, Cenſuring, and Condemning that which they do not underſtand. But to the Point and Matter.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For <hi>Arto-Latrie,</hi> the worſhipping of the Bread; I ſuppoſe there is none among us ſo ſenſeleſs and void of underſtanding, that doth or can think that in kneeling at the receiving of the Lords Supper we kneel to the Bread, or worſhip the Bread: They may as well think and ſay, that when in our prayers we kneel down before our ſeats, that we kneel to our ſeats and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip our ſeats. And for Tranſubſtantiation, it is well known that our Church doth utterly diſclaim it in her Doctrine, and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:64183:28"/> openly, as contrary to Senſe, Reaſon &amp; Religion, contrary to the Principles of all theſe, &amp; therefore doth not nor cannot acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg their Breaden God, We profeſs to the world, That the bread of Sacraments is to help our weakneſs, to ſtrengthen our faith &amp; to confirm it in the Promiſes of God. For God needeth them not to confer his Graces on us, but in Mercy he doth ordain them to help our underſtanding by our Senſes, to lead us by the Light, and to raiſe our minds from the conſideration of the Natural, earthly and ſenſible things, which we ſee with our eyes, to the underſtanding and conceiving of ſpiritual and heavenly Graces. For in every Sacrament there is the outward ſign, which is viſible, and the Inward Grace, which being ſpiritual and Inviſible, is by that Sign repreſented to us, and as it were laid before our eyes. To ſhew what Chriſt our Saviour hath done and ſuffered for us, and what he hath promiſed to do for all that by faith do lay hold upon him. Neither are they bare Signes Signifying, But Seals, Pledges and Aſſurances of the Promiſes of God to be received by Faith, and of that Communion which we have with Chriſt. <hi>Signa non mere Significativa ſed Exhibitiva,</hi> as <hi>Muſculus</hi> ſpeaketh on <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. Inſtruments alſo by Gods appointment and Bleſſing on them to conveigh Grace unto our Souls. Not as if of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves they did Sanctifie and Save <hi>(Ex Opere Operato)</hi> by the bare work done without faith. But by the vertue of Gods word and our applying the Promiſes to our ſelves according to the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God. For <hi>Non dant Sacramenta, quod datur per Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta.</hi> The Sacraments of themſelves do not give, that which God is pleaſed to give by the Sacraments. <hi>Fideles Salutem ex iſtis Elementis non quaerunt, etſi in Iſtis quaerunt. Non enim Iſta tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buunt, quod per Iſta Tribuitur,</hi> as <hi>Hugo</hi> ſaith; The faithful do not look for, ſeek or expect Grace or Salvation from thoſe elements, though they do expect it by and in the uſe of them. They of themſelves do not give, that which God is pleaſed by the Power of his word and for his promiſe ſake to give by them to thoſe which receive them by faith, as he hath Ordained. They are not Phyſical Inſtruments of our Salvation, as having in themſelves any vital efficacie; but only Moral Inſtruments of Gods Grace. The uſe whereof is in our hands, the effect in Gods, as that lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Hooker</hi> ſpeaketh.</p>

                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:64183:28"/> 2. For Idolatry. We conceive that Idolatry is the worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of a Strange God inſtead of the true God. The ſetting up of a falſe God in our hearts; or the worſhipping of the true God in a falſe and wrong manner. Now we worſhip the true God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that Rule and way which he hath preſcribed to us in the Scriptures, which we take to be his revealed word, to direct us how to worſhip him according to his will, that we may pleaſe God. We worſhip God aright, without Hereſie, Blaſphemy, or Idolatry. Not denying, but there may be ſome ſmall faults, Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and Corruptions in the matter of our Religion, or in the manner of our Worſhip, (becauſe we do not profeſs Perfection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but none ſuch as may or do overthrow the Ground and Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Faith. David, his Princes and Prieſts erred in carrying the Ark. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. contrary to the Law. <hi>Num.</hi> 7. 9. yet was the true Church of God; they ſacrificed in the high places, 2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 14. which ſhould have been done at Jeruſalem, the Paſſover was neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, 2 <hi>Ki.</hi> 23. yet the Church of God. The Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> was foulely tainted with errours in Doctrine and corruptions in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, as you find throughout the firſt Epiſtle of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> yet the Apoſtle calleth it the Church of God. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 2. And in adminiſtring and receiving the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, no man can ſay truly that we commit Idolatry. For we worſhip the true God maker of Heaven and Earth, and his Son Jeſus Chriſt, whom we profeſs to be our Saviour, and here we uſe this Ordinance to the right end, in remembrance of his Death and Sufferings, and we obſerve it according to his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution for the manner of it. And whereas we find no Geſture commanded or preſcribed in Scripture to be uſed at the receiving of it, though we count it as a thing indifferent in it ſelf, yet the Church for order, Decency and Edification, hath adjudged and preſcribed this poſture of kneeling at it, to be moſt fitting to ſhew our true Humility and Reverence to God and to his holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nance.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For Superſtition. This is a word (as many uſe it) of ſo large an extent, that I cannot tell how to fathome it or well what to make of it. But I conceive it muſt be taken from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:64183:29"/> 1. From <hi>Superſtes.</hi> Thus we may count that to be Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which hath outlived his right uſe, and overlived his right time ſo cometh to be abuſed and perverted from the firſt end, for which it was firſt appointed, and from the firſt uſe to which it was put; Thus many things have been and ſtill may be abuſed to Superſtition, which at their firſt ſetting up were good and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, or at leaſt not faulty, but indifferent in themſelves. Images, and Pictures and Statues had at firſt a fair ſeeming Beginning. When a father loſt a Son dear unto him whom Death had ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken away, he cauſed his Statute to be made to remember him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When a great man dyed, and ſometimes when they flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a great man, they cauſed his Image or Statute to be ſet up, which in proceſs of time was abuſed to Superſtition. They offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Sacrifices, Ceremonies, and Divine Honours to it, making it a God; ſo you find it written, <hi>Wiſ.</hi> 14. 13, 14, 15, 16. Thus came up the greateſt part of the Idolatry of the heathen; moſt of their Idols were at firſt the Images and Statutes of Men, whom Tyrants at laſt inforced the people to worſhip as Gods. Thus the Brazen Serpent was abuſed to Superſtition by Gods own people; it was at firſt commanded to be made and ſet up by God himſelf. <hi>Num.</hi> 21. for the benefit of the people and cure of them, which were bitten by the fiery Serpents. But in proceſs of time, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple offered incenſe to it; Therfore <hi>Hezekiah</hi> brake it in pieces, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Superſtitiouſly abuſed, &amp; called it <hi>Nehuſhtan.</hi> 2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 18. 4. Thus fome are of opinion that <hi>Gideons</hi> ephod was ſet up at firſt only to be a monument of his great and miraculous victory over the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianites;</hi> but in proceſs of time it was abuſed to Idolatry, as it is ſaid, <hi>Judg.</hi> 8. 27. All Iſrael went a Whoring after it, which was the deſtruction of <hi>Gideon</hi> and his houſe; all theſe had out-lived their right uſe, and over lived their right time; were abuſed to Superſtition and ſo might well be accounted and called Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From <hi>Super Statutum,</hi> Above that which is commanded, thus alſo we may call that Superſtitious which is more then God commandeth, when we add any thing to that which God hath commanded in his law, putting holineſs in it or laying a neceſſity upon it, for you muſt remember that we confine Superſtition to
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:64183:29"/> matters of Religion and thoſe things which concern the ſervice and worſhip of God; the Rule which God giveth for his Service and worſhip is ſet down by <hi>Moſes, Deut.</hi> 4. 2. <hi>Ye ſhall put nothing to the word which I command you, neither ſhall you take any thing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, that you may keep the Commandements of the Lord your God, which I command you.</hi> Thus the Jewes were noted to be very Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious; They added to Gods commandments, the Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their Elders, putting holineſs in them, &amp; laying a neceſſity upon them, as our Saviour telleth them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 3. Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Commandments of God by their Traditions, and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching for Doctrines the precepts of men, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. Not only equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling their Traditions to the written word, but breaking Gods Commandments by their Traditions, <hi>Mark</hi> 7. 8. Laying apart the Commandment of God, &amp; obſerving the Traditions of men, preferring them before Gods Commandments. So again Chriſt complaineth of them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 5. They made broad their Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacteries and made long the Fringes of their Garments, not but that theſe things were commanded, as you find <hi>Numb.</hi> 15. 38, 39. but they would make them larger and longer then was required, to have the praiſe of men. They were much noted alſo for their ſtrict keeping of the Sabbath; they added that <hi>Sabbaculum</hi> (as it was called) That addition of time annexed to the Sabbath, ſome beginning it ſooner then others, as the Jews dwelling at <hi>Tiberias.</hi> Some continuing it longer then others, as they that dwelt at <hi>Tſepphore.</hi> Again ſome thought they were too preciſe in many things, as in dreſſing no Meat upon the Sabbath, extending that <hi>Exodus</hi> 16. 23. to all Ages, which others thought was proper only to the time of <hi>Manna;</hi> in kindling no fire upon the Sabbath, grounding on <hi>Exodus</hi> 35. 3. which others reſtrained only to the fire for the furtherance of the work of the Tabernacle, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining from all manner of work, without exception upon the Sabbath. They would not ſo much as fight to preſerve themſelvs againſt their enemies, aſſaulting them on the Sabbath day, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by (as <hi>Joſephus</hi> writeth) they became a Prey unto their enemies, firſt to <hi>Antiochus (Joſeph, lib.</hi> 12. <hi>cap.</hi> 8.) whereupon <hi>Matthias</hi> made a decree, that it ſhould be lawful on the Sabbath to reſiſt their enemies, which decree again they underſtanding ſtrictly, as
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:64183:30"/> if it did give only leave to Reſiſt, when they were actually aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and not by any labour that day to prevent the enemies rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Rams, Setting of Engines, Under minings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Prey the ſecond time to <hi>Pompey.</hi> They were ſo preciſe that they held it unlawful to roaſt an Apple, gather an Hearb, climb a Tree, to kill or catch a Flea upon the Sabbath-day; you know the ſtory of the Jew, who falling into the Jakes would not be helped out becauſe it was their Sabbath-day. This we count Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Super Statutum.</hi> To add any thing to Gods Law, or to be too ſtrict in Tying our ſelves to more then God requireth of us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. From <hi>Super-Stare;</hi> thus I conceive we may not unfitly call him Superſtitious, who in matters of Religion ſtandeth too much upon his own opinion, Judgment, will or affections; who is ſo high in his own conceit, and wedded to his own affections, puffed up with his own pride and ſelf conceit, that he will not yeild an Inch to the Judgment of others, ſtanding upon Trifles and poor needleſs things, which in their own nature are indifferent, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a Rupture, breach and Schiſm in the Church, as if thoſe poor indifferent things were ſuch, as wherein the very Soul, ſubſtance and heart of Religion, did conſiſt, and were the ſumm of all and life of all, whereas they are ſuch as ſcarce come nigh to touch the Fringe of Chriſts veſture, and very unworthy to be made matter and fuel of contention in the Church. We ſhould all ſtrive to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Peace and Unity in the Church, bearing one with another and ſupporting one another, yea yielding one to another in things which in themſelves are indifferent; Indeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace.</p>
               <p>Thus a man may <hi>Super-Stare,</hi> and be accounted this way Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious two manner of ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In his opinion and judgment. When he ſtandeth too much upon his own judgment, and is too wiſe in his own eyes. Thus too many are too ſtrongly &amp; too highly conceited of themſelves, lifted up with the conceit of their own knowledg, gifts and Parts, thinking themſelves wiſer then all others, and ſo will not vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to ſubmit to, not ſo much as to ask or hear the judgment of others or their reaſons. Yet Solomon doth tell us, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26. 12.

                     </gap> of ſuch a one.</hi> He is one of <hi>Solomons</hi> incurable fools; Bray him in a Mortar, yet will his folly return; ſay what you will, you cannot Convince him. All the Reaſon in the world cannot bear him down. Some we know in theſe late times of Liberty, have been bold to Brand all the Rites, Cuſtomes, and Ancient Faſhions, which were Inſtituted by our Forefathers, with the name of Idolatry and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, yea Chriſtian Burial it ſelfe: That for a Miniſter to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the Dead Body to the Grave, and there to give an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation was Idolatry and Superſtition; yet there we neither Worſhipped the Dead, nor Prayed for the Dead, onely gave an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to the Living; and at that time and there in that place at the Grave, to give ſome honour to the Dead: To put ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the Burial of a Chriſtian and the Burial of a Beaſt. Surely our Saviour made no ſuch difference of places by his own Example, but one may be as Lawful to Teach in as another. He Taught ſometimes upon a Mount, ſometimes in the Synagogue; ſometimes in a Houſe, ſometimes in a Ship by the Sea-ſide. Some again have conceited our Fonts to be Superſtitiouſly placed in the lower part of the Church: Though our very Churches and all that belong unto our Churches (if that people did underſtand the Grounds and true Reaſons of thoſe things) were Ordered, Setled, and Diſpoſed of with ſo much Knowledge, Wiſdome and Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that no man who underſtandeth himſelf can juſtly except a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. For all that was done by our Forefathers (though we judge our ſelves to be much wiſer then they were) all that was Inſtituted, and appointed by them in thoſe things for Order, Time, Manner, Place, and all ſuch Circumſtances, was very Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant, (though all know not the Grounds of them) as may eaſily appear by Particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Our Churches are all generally Built upon Mounts, Hills and Hillocks, with an Aſcending up unto them. To teach us, that when we come up unto the Church, we ſhould Mount up in our Hearts and Affections unto God, leaving all earthly thoughts and things below, <hi>Setting your affections on things above, and not upon things below,</hi> as it is, <hi>Coloſs.</hi> 3. 2.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Our Churches are all Uniformely Built: Set Eaſt and Weſt, and the Seats for the People, both in Hearing the Word, and in
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:64183:31"/> Praying to look Eaſtward. And why? To remember us of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, which we have by the Lord Jeſus our Saviour: The firſt News of whoſe Birth was brought to Jeruſalem by the wiſe Men, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2. 2. from the Eaſt: The Jews counted the Eaſt to be a Coaſt</p>
               <p n="1">1. Hateful, becauſe there was the firſt ſin committed by <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> in Paradiſe in the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> which was Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 8. Eating the Forbidden Fruit.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Unclean, becauſe there the firſt Blood was ſhed by <hi>Cain,</hi> who ſlew his Brother <hi>Abel,</hi> and was an Inhabitant of the Eaſt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 26.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Curſed, becauſe there was the firſt Curſe laid upon the Earth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 17. for the ſin of Man; <hi>Curſed be the Earth for thy ſake,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Therefore God in his wiſdome appointed; That as the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of ſin was in the Eaſt, ſo thence ſhould come the firſt News of our Salvation, by the Birth of our Saviour Chriſt Jeſus. The uncleanneſs of the Eaſt, ſhould be purged by the appearing of the Star in the Eaſt, and the Curſe laid on the Earth taken away and blotted out by the Bleſſing of Chriſt. Wherefore, whereas the Jews did ordinarily Pray towards the Weſt; The Moores and Saracens toward the South; We Chriſtians Pray towards the Eaſt; and it was the Ancient cuſtome in Baptiſme, when they Renounced the Devil and all his Works, To turn themſelves toward the Weſt; but when they made Confeſſion of their Faith, to look and turn towards the Eaſt. And it is an Ancient Tradition of the Church, That when Chriſt ſhall come to Judgement at the laſt day, He ſhall firſt ariſe and appear in the Eaſt, and accordingly (you ſee) we make our Graves for the Dead, and lay in our Dead with their Faces toward the Eaſt, as if they ſhould riſe and ſtand upon their Feet (at the Reſurrection) to meet the Lord in the Eaſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Our Fonts are placed uſually in the lower part of the Church, and not far from the Entry into the Church: To ſhew that by the Sacrament of Baptiſm, we are admitted into the Church, Matricu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, and ſo made Partakers of all the Priviledges of the Church. For the Sacrament of Baptiſm was called by the Ancients, <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum Initiationis, Janua Caeli, Primus Chriſtianorum Introitus.</hi> The Door of Entrance into the Church, The Door of Admiſſion,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:64183:31"/> The Gate of Heaven. Out of the Church there is no Salvation. He that hath not the Church for his Mother, ſhall never have God for his Father.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The very Yew Trees, which in moſt places of our Coaſt (capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of their Growing) were formerly Planted generally in our Church-yards neer to the Church, though therein they might have ſome Politick and civil conſideration, thereby to defend the Building of the Church from the violence of Wind and Weather; yet I cannot conceive, but they had a Myſtical and Moral Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in it. That they had an intent to teach us ſomewhat by it, becauſe this Yew Tree (as I imagine) may be accounted a fit Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem of a Chriſtian, a fit Picture, Patern and Reſemblance for a Chriſtian to Obſerve, when he looketh upon it. You ſee it hath little outſide Rinde or Barke, onely a ſmall Filme. To teach us not to make a fair outſide and Formality of our Religion to the world, but to be without Hypocriſie, Formality or Diſſimulation. Then it is a very Firme, Faſt, Sound and Hearty Tymber, by far harder then Oake, to ſhew the Soundneſs and Sincerity of a Chriſtian. It hath many and ſpreading Branches large and fair growing out, to remember us to be plentiful in good Works. It is always green and proſpering, to declare unto us That a Chriſtian ſhould always thrive and grow in Grace. Yea, Green in Winter and in the Hardeſt weather; To ſhew that a Chriſtian is beſt in Affliction, Adverſity and Perſecution. Yea then it hath Berries on it, to teach us, as then we are the beſt Chriſtians, ſo then and always to bring forth the Fruits of Righteouſneſs. It is a long living and laſting Tree, To be a Type unto us of Immortality and Eternal Life. Thus you ſee a Man may Read a Lecture of Divinity and Chriſtianity to you, by the Obſervations which may be gathered from this Tree: Now then let wiſe men judge whether thoſe Ancients, who did all upon ſuch good Grounds and Reaſons, or theſe Young ſelfe-conceited Men, who cenſure and condemne all Antiquity, and the Ancient Orders of the Church of Superſtition (becauſe they do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Reaſons of them) be moſt Guilty of Superſtition; and whether theſe men do not <hi>Super Stare,</hi> Stand too much upon their own Opinion and Judgement, making diſturbance in the Church about ſuch things, and in this regard, may not thus be called and accounted Superſtitious themſelves. </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:64183:32"/> 2. In his Will and Affections. Thus likewiſe a man may <hi>Super Stare,</hi> ſtand too much upon his own Will, Humour and Affections: Though his Judgement be convinced, yet he may count it a diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to yeeld and to ſubmit, and therefore meerly out of wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs will ſtand againſt thoſe Orders which are Required, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and Commanded. It was an old ſaying of <hi>Seneca</hi> that Divine Heathen, <hi>Regis animum intra ſe quiſque habet,</hi> Every man hath the mind of a King within him: He would Command over others, but cannot indure to be Commanded by others. The Obſervation was of old, <hi>Nitimur in vetitum ſemper cupimuſque negata.</hi> It is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to all to deſire that which is Forbidden, and to Kick againſt that which is Impoſed and Commanded, and ſome (I fear) are of ſuch a Humour, ſo croſs and perverſe a diſpoſition, that they will not ſubmit but ſtand up againſt that which is Commanded ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, though they can give no other Reaſon for it, but onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is impoſed and Commanded; They will not be under Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. Yet I make no queſtion but ſome are right honeſt men, and truely pretend Conſcience; That they cannot ſubmit to ſuch Orders, and to ſuch and ſuch Rites. There is great and good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that every man ſhould ſatisfie his own Conſcience, and not ſin againſt his Conſcience, but yet we muſt not purpoſely make and frame our ſelves a Conſcience: A good Conſcience is and ought to be grounded on Judgement, and that Judgement ſhould be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated and Setled by right Reaſon; therefore he that deſireth to ſatisfie his Conſcience in any thing, muſt lay aſide his Affections, and all Self-conceits and prejudicate paſſions, and muſt deſire and indeavour to be informed in the Truth of things, eſpecially ſuch things as are doubtful to him, to Hear and Examine the Judgement of others, and their Reaſons; and to weigh them in an equal Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance without Prejudice, Paſſion or Self-conceit; otherwiſe we frame a Conſcience to our ſelves and make it Erroneous; and an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous Conſcience can do us no good, but deceive us. I fear that many of theſe honeſt-minded Men are miſtaken meerly through Ignorance, becauſe they do not ſearch into the Grounds and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of things, nor rightly underſtand them. How theſe Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, Rites and Orders firſt came up in the Church, how they are Impoſed and Uſed, whether they be accounted things indifferent in themſelves, or whether they put Holineſs in them, or lay any
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:64183:32"/> neceſſity upon them for Salvation, or are onely Commanded and uſed for Order, Decency and Edification. Surely it theſe men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men of moderate Spirits, were rightly informed, and would lay aſide all prejudice, paſſion and ſelf-conceit; they would be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfied in their Conſciences and ſubmit unto them. Yet wee cannot but be afraid again, that ſome are ſo high in their Spirits, that they are aſhamed to Submit. They have opened their Mouths ſo much heretofore, and been ſo high in their Speeches and Invec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives againſt this Government, theſe Rites and Orders, (being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Grounds of their firſt Inſtitution, and not dreaming of a Change, that now, though their Judgement be Convinced and Satisfied, yet they are aſhamed to own them, to come in and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit unto them, for fear they ſhall be Derided of all, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached of all; and therefore ſtand out, pretending Conſcience, whereas they do purpoſely frame themſelves a Conſcience, and it is nothing but Humour, Will, Peeviſhneſs and wilful Affections, which make them to ſtand out, and ſo do maintain a Fire and Faction in the Church. Theſe ſurely do <hi>Super Stare.</hi> As the other ſtood too much upon their Opinion and Judgement, being wiſe in their own eyes, and ſo counted Superſtitious in the ſame manner: Theſe ſtand upon their own Will, Wilfulneſs and corrupt Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, reſolving to be croſs to all for fear they ſhould come into Contempt, and ſo in this reſpect may be likewiſe accounted Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being rightly conſidered, How can this Ceremony of Kneeling at the Receiving of the Lords Supper be accounted <hi>Artolatrie,</hi> Idolatry or Superſtition? We worſhip not the Bread but the true God, and in a right Manner; we diſclaim all Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; we do not abuſe this Ceremony of Kneeling to put any holineſs in it, or lay any neceſſity upon it: but account it as a thing indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in it ſelf. The Church doth Command and Require it, onely for Decency, Uniformity and Order, Judgeing it to be the fitteſt Geſture to ſhew our Humility to God, and our Reverence to the Ordinance of God.</p>

Now for our Ceremonies, No man can prove, that any of them are Repugnant or Contrary to the Word of God, and ſo unlawful in themſelves. But the long diſuſe of them in theſe Late broken times, and the fierce clamour of ſome hot Spirits againſt them, not rightly underſtanding the firſt Grounds and beginning of them, nor the true manner of our Churches Impoſing and Requiring of them: Suppoſing that She layeth ſome kind of neceſſity upon them for Salvation, and putteth ſome kind of Holineſs in them, have much Exaſperated mens minds, and raiſed a greater Prejudice againſt them then they do deſerve, or otherwiſe would have been. But to Anſwer to Particulars;</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the Idolizing of this Book, We muſt acknowledge, Wiſe men and Good men, they have not onely their Affections, but their Errours and Failings. There is too much bitterneſs among us. Some perhaps may overvalue this Book and dote too much upon it, as if there were no other way ſo good, whereby we might ſo ſerve God as to pleaſe Him. Yet then again we may ſee that others undervalue it as much, ſpeak as contemptuouſly of it and againſt it, as if this way of Service were abomination before God. What is there whereof all conceive alike? The Spider draweth Poyſon, where the Bee ſucketh Honey; That which is one mans Meat (as the Proverb goeth) is another mans Poyſon. There ſhould be a Spirit of moderation among us. We profeſs that this Book is the Work of Man, and as by Man it was firſt made, ſo by Man it may be at any time altered or put down, and there is no Work of Man ſo Compleat and perfect but may have in it ſome Imperfection, or be Tainted with ſome Errour or Corruption. And again, that this Forme is not ſet up and Impoſed, as if it were of abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity: That we could not ſerve God aright without it, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for convenience, as Judged moſt Expedient to prevent Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages, to repreſs, ſtop and reſtrain Schiſmes, Factions, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies and Errours in the Church: which have grown (as we Judge)
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:64183:33"/> and multiplied much among us by reaſon of that Liberty given to every one to uſe what Form he would. It is onely to preſerve Peace, Unity, Order and Uniformity in the Church: Now let it be granted, that this Book is too much heightned by ſome (which perhaps may be done in oppoſition to others, who undervalue it ſo much) yet as long as it is lawful in it ſelf, not contrary to the Word of God, and Injoyned and Impoſed by Authority, what good Reaſon can be given by any Man, why we may not uſe it, nevertheleſs in a fair moderate way.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For theſe Ceremonies, The Croſs and Surplice, which they call Popiſh, It cannot be proved that the Pope brought theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church. It is certain, that theſe are far more Ancient then the Pope; yet we cannot think that the Popes fingers are ſo foule (as <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> ſpeaketh) that they defile every thing he touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, or that we may not uſe ſome things, which the Papiſts uſe, ſo that we do not uſe them in that Superſtitious manner, which the Papiſts do. If we may make uſe of nothing, which they do or have abuſed, we muſt forſake all our Churches, caſt off not not onely the Creed, but the Lords Prayer and the Sacraments: Neither do we borrow theſe Ceremonies of the Papiſts; for from the beginning of our Reformation theſe were never removed, but ſtill retained in our Church, not by Popiſh Order, but by the Princes Law, as things indifferent in themſelves, and uſed onely in a Politick and Civil way, for diſtinction of Perſons, Order, Decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Comelineſs, not placing any Religion in them, or holding them as neceſſary to Salvation. We have ſhewed you already what Popery is; we cannot Judge or Cenſure all to be Popery which the Papiſts uſe, but Popery is properly the Errours, Corruptions, Superſtitions, Idolatries and abominations of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> either in Doctrine or Worſhip. And for theſe Ceremonies it is eaſie to be proved, that they were uſed in the Church before the Name of Pope was known, or was extant in the world. The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> for three hundred years after Chriſt and more were Godly Biſhops, and moſt of them Martyrs, as all Hiſtories ſhew And though Antichriſt was born (as ſome imagine) under <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> when (as <hi>Platina</hi> writeth) there was a voice heard from Heaven <hi>Seminatum est venenum in Eccleſia.</hi> Yet moſt of the Learned agree, that he was never ſet in his Throne till the time of <hi>Phocas</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:64183:34"/> who ſlew <hi>Mauritius</hi> his Lord, and took his Room, which was between five and ſix hundred years after Chriſt. Then this <hi>Phocas</hi> the Emperor granted to <hi>Boniface</hi> the Third then Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> the Stile of Biſhop <hi>Oec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>l</hi> or Biſhop Univerſal, to have the Power and Superiority over all Biſhops and Churches. Then was the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> ſet up as Pope. Now theſe Ceremonies were in uſe long before that time, as may eaſily appear, if we inſiſt upon them ſeverally.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the Sign of the Croſs, This was very Ancient.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Though Jews and Gentiles derided both the Apoſtles and Chriſtians for Preaching and Believing in him who was Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified upon the Croſs, yet they triumphed and rejoyced in the Ignominy of the Croſs. The Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 18. <hi>For the Preaching of the Croſs is to them that periſh, fooliſhneſs: but unto us who are ſaved, it is the power of God.</hi> Compriſing under the Name of the Croſs not onely Chriſt Crucified, but the Merits of his Death, with all the Fruits and Benefits we pertake thereby.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe the Name of the Croſs was ſo hateful to Jew and Gentile, but eſpecially to the Jews, therefore the Chriſtians, either in the Apoſtles time or ſhortly after uſed much the Sign of the Croſs in all their Actions, thereby making a Profeſſion (to the Amazement of the Jew) that they were not aſhamed to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Him for their Lord and Saviour, who died for them upon the Croſs. This Sign they did not onely uſe themſelves with a kinde of Glory, when they met with any of the Jews; but Signed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with their Children when they were Baptized, educating them by that Badge to the Service of him in whom they did Believe. And this uſe of the Sign of the Croſs in Baptiſm was conſtantly held in the Primitive Church, as well by the Greek Church, as by the Latine Church, by the Eaſt and Weſt Church with one conſent, as is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and evident by many teſtimonies of the Ancient Fathers: <hi>Quod omnia Chriſti Beneſicia recordari nos faciat,</hi> ſaith <hi>Cyril,</hi> Becauſe it maketh us to remember all the Benefits of Chriſt. And Doctor <hi>Whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e</hi> tells us, That the Chriſtians in the Primitive Times Anciently uſed the Signing of the Body with the Sign of the Croſs, to theſe Ends;</p>
               <p n="1">1. To profeſs to the World, That they were not aſhamed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge Chriſt Crucified for their Saviour.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:64183:34"/> 2. That they were not aſhamed of the Perſecutions and Croſſes, which befell them for his ſake.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That they hoped for Redemption and Salvation by Chriſt Crucified, whom the Jews and Gentiles deſpiſed.</p>
               <p>But the Sign of the Croſs was the Sign Tranſient, made with the Finger, Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> ſaith. That the Sign of the Croſs made with the Finger) was in uſe and Common in the Purer Church; but the Sign of the Croſs in any Mettal not till four hundred years after Chriſt. And <hi>Chemnetius</hi> ſaith, In the Primitive times there was not any Image or Figure of the Face of a Man, having his Armes ſpread out and Nailed to the Croſs. But in the daies of <hi>Tertullian</hi> and afterward, the Chriſtians did faſhion a Tranſverſe Figure as it were a Croſs, and did Sign themſelves. But this Sign Tranſient was not a Sign of Worſhip or Adoration, for that there was not any thing really ſubſiſtent in that Sign, but it was onely a Profeſſion; a Profeſſion and Remembrance, That they ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt Crucified and put all their Hope and Confidence in Him. Now there could not be the like Superſtition in the Croſs, as it is a Sign Tranſient, as there may be in it when it is a Sign Permanent, made of Wood or Mettal. And that the Sign of the Croſs was had in great regard, is plain, becauſe <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſtian Princes at this day uſe the ſame Croſs in their Armes and Banners both in Peace and in War, in token that they fight un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Banner of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It muſt be confeſſed, That in Proceſs of time the Sign of the Croſs was greatly abuſed in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> eſpecially after that the Corruption of Popery had gotten the Head. They did A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore the Croſs, giving to it Divine Worſhip, and did aſcribe unto it ſtrange effects, to the bare Sign of the Croſs, <hi>Ex Opere Operato;</hi> That the bare Signing of themſelves with the Sign of the Croſs, had Vertue and Power againſt Magick Spels, Sorcery, Witchcraft and the like Illuſions of the Devil: Indeed we read of ſtrange Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles wrought by God in the Primitive times, <hi>Adhibito Sign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis.</hi> But they were not done by the bare Sign of the Croſs, but by the Faith of them that Believed on Chriſt, who was Crucified upon the Croſs. If ſuch things were done as we Read of, ſurely they were not wrought by the Vertue and Power of the Sign of the Croſs. but by Faith in Chriſt, who dyed upon the Croſs, by
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:64183:35"/> the verture and power of Faith in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now the Church of <hi>England</hi> being to make a Reformation in her Doctrine and Worſhip, and Conſidering That the Abuſe of a thing doth not take away the Lawful uſe of it; Among other Ceremonies retained this Ancient one, but purged from all Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Superſtition and Error: The Sign of the Croſs (not in, but after Baptiſm) being approved by the Judgement and Practice of thoſe Reverend and Godly Divines, which were in the days of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, and Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and many ſince: But with theſe Cautions following.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Sign of the Croſs is no part of the Subſtance of the Sacrament of Baptiſm, nor addeth to the perfection of it any thing, nor being omitted doth Diminiſh any thing of the Effect of Baptiſm. So that the Church layeth no Neceſſity upon it, as if it were Neceſſary to Salvation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Infant Baptized, is by vertue of Baptiſm, before it is Signed with the Sign of the Croſs, received into the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of Chriſts Flock as a perfect Member thereof, and not by any power aſcribed to the Sign of the Croſs. So that the Church putteth no Holineſs in it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the Church of <hi>England</hi> following the practice of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Churches, doth upon theſe Grounds retain the Sign of the Croſs (after Baptiſme) thus purged from all Popiſh Superſtition &amp; Error, putting no Holineſs in it, nor Neceſſity of it, but accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it onely as a thing indifferent in it ſelf, yet a Lawful outward Ceremony and Honourable Badge, whereby the Infant is Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Service of Him that died upon the Croſs; Dedicated, not by way of Conſecration, but Declaration and Proteſtation; that is, Not as a token of Grace received from God by ſuch a Sign made; But as a token of Duty, which afterward the Perſon Baptized ought to perform concerning his conſtant and viſible Profeſſion of the Chriſtian Faith.</p>
               <p>Thus there is a vaſt difference between the Papiſts and us in the Uſe of this Sign of the Croſs. The Papiſts uſe it immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Baptiſm, and put Holineſs in it, aſcribing to it Miraculous Effects, driving away Devils, expelling Diſeaſes, ſanctifying the Perſons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore, our Church to croſs the Superſtition of Papiſts hath ordained, That the Sign of the Croſs ſhould be uſed
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:64183:35"/> after that Baptiſm is fully ended, puting no Holineſs in it, nor lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Neceſſity upon it, acknowledging no vertue in it, but uſe it onely as Primitively it was uſed; that is, onely as a Token, whereby there is a Proteſtation made of a future Conſtancy in the Profeſſion of Chriſtianity: And <hi>Zanchie</hi> ſaith, That this uſe of the Sign of the Croſs To teſtifie that we are not aſhamed of Chriſt Crucified, is not to be diſliked.</p>

               <p n="1">1. There is <hi>Neceſſitas Impoſitionis.</hi> A Neceſſity of the Impoſition of a thing; when a thing or Ceremony is ſuppoſed and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded as a part of Gods worſhip, or as having power and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in it to ſanctifie the worſhipper, or as any way Neceſſary to Salvation: Then there is a Neceſſity of the Impoſition of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe without it the Worſhip and Service of God is maymed and wronged. But if the Thing or Ceremony Commanded be a thing indifferent in it ſelf, and uſed in the Worſhip of God onely for Edification, Decency and Order, and being uſed, addeth nothing to the perfection of that Service, and being omitted and left out, diminiſheth nothing from the Effect of it, there can be no Neceſſity of the Impoſition of it, in regard of the Thing or Ceremony Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and Required.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is <hi>Neceſſitas Obedientiae.</hi> A Neceſſity of our Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to our Lawful Magiſtrates in Church and Common-wealth, in things Lawful, indifferent, and not contrary to the Word of God, for Order and for Government: Thus we are Commanded <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1. <hi>Let every Soul be ſubject to the higher powers;</hi> I and without this, If we deny our Rulers this power, That they have no Authority to make Laws in indifferent things, we do not onely weaken the Arme of Authority, but we break all Government in Church and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:64183:36"/> Common wealth, and cannot but ſee what unnatural Conſequences of all Diſorder are like to inſue upon it, in Church, in State, in Families, in all Societies of the world; Confuſion will, and of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity muſt follow, if they have no power to make Laws for Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, Decency and Order in Things indifferent, and not contrary to the Word of God. But if they have power by Laws to Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the Circumſtances of Gods Worſhip in indifferent things for Peace, Unity, Order and Decency, as the Apoſtle adviſeth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 40. <hi>Let all things be done Decently and in Order:</hi> Then it muſt needs be granted, that it is our Duty to Obey them in ſuch their Determinations. Thus you ſee, there is and will be a Neceſſity of our Obedience. To apply this plainly and fully, we acknowledge there is no Neceſſity of the Impoſition of this Ceremony of the Croſs in Baptiſm or after Baptiſm, becauſe we neither Judge it in it ſelf neceſſary any way to Salvation, nor put any Holineſs in it, but in that reſpect it may be as well left out and omitted as uſed; neither can we think that our Governours themſelves put any Opinion of Neceſſity or Religion in it, ſeeing they do openly Declare themſelves to the contrary in the Doctrine of our Church, as you may eaſily perceive, if you look upon our Book of Canons, and Examine the xxx. Canon: The title whereof is, The Lawful Uſe of the Croſs in Baptiſm Explained. But ſeeing this Ceremony hath been ſo Anciently and Conſtantly Uſed in the Primitive Churches, ſtill uſed in our Church, and never put down by any Lawful Authority, but ſtill retained and Eſtabliſhed by our Laws, yet onely for Diſcipline and Order, and upon no other account of Holineſs or Neceſſity: There is a Neceſſity of our Obedience in it to the Command of our Governours, and to the Authority of the Church, as long as the Ceremony it ſelf is Lawful in it ſelf, not Contrary to the Word of God; may be Lawfully uſed upon this Account, and that it is the pleaſure of King and Parliament to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyne it, Require it, and Command it. Things in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Indifferent, being Commanded or Forbidden by a Lawful Magiſtrate, do in ſome ſort alter their nature in reſpect of the Tie of our Obedience. And therefore, becauſe this Ceremony is Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed and Commanded by Authority, the Church expecteth Obedience at our hands. Thus you may plainly perceive the difference between the Neceſſity of the Impoſition of it, and the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:64183:36"/> Neceſſity of our Obedience and Submiſſion to it, when it is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and Injoyned.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the Surplice; there is no reaſonable Man but will allow of Diſtinction of degrees among Men. Then how ſhall they be known but by their ſeveral Veſtments, Cloaths and Habites? Judges are diſcerned by their Robes, Serjeants at Law by their Coifes, Aldermen by their Gowns; Schollers in the Univerſities, and their ſeveral Degrees, by their ſeveral Habites, Caps and Hoods; why then ſhould it be any way inconvenient or accounted an Indecorum or unſeemly thing in Miniſters, to have ſome Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in their Apparel from others, to be known and differenced from others? and if we Examine this Veſture of the Surplice, we ſhall find it Uſed before Popery was in the world. So that Diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Apparel (and more particularly of this Veſtment) had not his beginning from the Pope. <hi>Euſebius</hi> Recordeth out of the moſt Ancient Writers, That <hi>John</hi> the Apoſtle wore at <hi>Epheſus</hi> a Biſhops Attire upon his Head, terming it <hi>Pelatum ſeu Lamina Pontificalis;</hi> and <hi>Pontius</hi> the Deacon Writeth of Biſhop <hi>Cyprian</hi> the Martyr, That a little before he ſhould be Beheaded, he gave to him that ſhould Behead him his Veſture called <hi>Birrus,</hi> and to his Deacon his Veſture called <hi>Dalmatica,</hi> and ſo ſtood himſelf in Linnen. And that the Apparel of the Prieſts and Miniſters of the Church was Diſtinct from Lay-men in the old Church of the Primitive Times, is Apparent by the Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory of <hi>Theodoret, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 27. And by the Writings of <hi>Socrates, lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 22. Yea, there was a Diſtinct Apparel between the Chriſtians and Gentiles; we find it was the Cuſtome when Chriſtians were firſt Converted and came to Chriſts Religion, and were admitted into the Church, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a Gown they did wear a Cloak, for which cauſe when they were mocked of the Gentiles, <hi>Tertullian</hi> Wrote a Learned Book <hi>De Pallio,</hi> In defence of the Cloak of that Faſhion and Cuſtome. And as they had their ſeveral Diſtinctions of Apparel between Chriſtians and Gentiles, ſo eſpecially between Miniſters and Lay-people. And that white Linnen for Miniſterial Apparel was uſed in the Church, is plain to all. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> in his <hi>Homil.</hi> 38. on St <hi>Matthews</hi> Goſpel, ſpeaking of Miniſters ſaith, This is your Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, your Stay, your Crown, not that you walk through the Church in white Veſtments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Hierom. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>contra</hi>

We find that that the Jews (Gods own people) eſpecially the Nobler ſort of them, were wont to Wear, and were much delighted in white Cloaths. Therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaketh thus to the Epicure, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9. 8. <hi>At all times let thy Garments be White,</hi> that is; Be merry, put on thy beſt Cloaths and keep Holy day.

It is worth our obſervation, which the Evangeliſts note out unto us. You find that the Souldiers of <hi>Pilate</hi> the Romane Deputy put upon our Saviour Chriſt a Scarlet Robe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. 28. or as <hi>Mark</hi> hath it, <hi>Mark</hi> 15. 17. and <hi>John, Joh.</hi> 19. 5. <hi>a purple Garment,</hi> which is alſo a very pleaſant Red.

They were doubtleſs at fitſt ordained and appointed</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the Honour of the Miniſterie; that they might be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted and received as the Miniſters, Servants and Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Not onely for their Eſtimation, but for Diſtinction ſake to have them known and diſcerned from others; that they might have that Honour and Reſpect given them, which was due to their Perſons and Places.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To ſhew the Puritie and Holineſs, The unſpottedneſs of Life and Converſation, which is required in the Miniſters of the Church.</p>
               <p>But ſome may conceive the Surplice to be Borrowed from the Linnen Ephod of the Levites, and ſo a Levitical Rite brought into our Church.</p>
               <p>We cannot deny but in the Levitical Law God commanded an Ephod to be made, and to be uſed, and put on by the Prieſts when they ſhould do Sacrifice; and we find that there were two kinds of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There was one which the High Prieſt onely uſed and did put on. It was made of Purple, Violet colour Silke, and Scarlet. It had Gold wrought in it and ſundrie kinds of moſt Pretious Stones, as you may ſee, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. 28.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:64183:38"/> 2. There was another called <hi>Ephod Bad;</hi> that is, A Linnen Ephod, which the Levites alſo uſed in Holy Services. You Read, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. <hi>that</hi> Hannah <hi>made every year for</hi> Samuel <hi>a little Coat and an Ephod,</hi> when ſhe had given him to the Lord to Miniſter in the Tabernacle. <hi>Yea</hi> David <hi>being girt with an Ephod,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 14. <hi>danced before the Ark.</hi> It is there ſaid <hi>That</hi> David <hi>danced before the Lord with all his might and was girded with a Linnen Ephod.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But you muſt know, that the Ephod though it come over their Shoulders, yet came not down much farther then their Waſte, not down to the Ground as the Surplice doth, and was Girded on, wherewith they did uſually Truſs up and Gird up their other Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But the Surplices are long Veſtments to come down to the feet, and are to hang looſe and not to be Girt about us; therefore cannot be thought to be the Levitical Ephod. And if we may believe. <hi>Platina In Vita Stephani, Stephen</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who was a Godly Biſhop and a Conſtant Martyr under <hi>Decius</hi> the Emperour, was the firſt Inventor and Appointer of the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice, who lived <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 256. Two hundred fifty and ſix years after the Birth of our Saviour Chriſt, long before Popery was known in the World, and ever ſince Retained in the Church.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Partly for the Honour of the Miniſtry.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Partly for the Diſtinction of the Miniſter from the People.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And partly again, to ſhew the Purity, Holyneſs, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpottedneſs of Life and Converſation which is required in the Miniſters of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For the laſt Particle of this laſt Objection, That the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of theſe Ceremonies is Contrary to our Chriſtian Liberty: Be pleaſed to take notice, that we deny not Chriſtian Liberty; we know the Charge St. <hi>Paul</hi> giveth to the Galatians, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>Stand faſt in the Liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made us free, and be not In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

Here you ſee we are adviſed to continue in the ſame Particular and Private Trade, Profeſſion, Quality and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, wherein we are Set and Called in the Common-wealth, though we be partakers of that General and Effectual Calling of a Chriſtian. Though we be Converted and Called to be Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, yet we muſt not Change our Particular Vocation, State, Quality and Condition; though we be Servants, we muſt abide and continue in it; Chriſtian Liberty doth not Exempt from Obedience thoſe that are any way under the Government of others. Their Chriſtian Liberty doth no way Croſs their Private and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Calling, or any way infringe or take off their outward duty in their Place and Calling to their Superiours, or Exempt them from Obedience to the Juſt Laws of Men, though they be Servants. Neither is this Liberty (called Chriſtian Liberty) meant or inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to take us off or Exempt us from Obedience to the Magiſtrate and Laws of the Land Injoyning that which is Lawful and Honeſt, and not contrary to the Word of God.

                     </gap> and in Order.</hi> Thoſe Actions, Things and Rites, which in their own nature are Indifferent, neither preciſely Commanded nor expreſſely Forbidden in the Word of God; As to Eate ſuch a day Fleſh, and ſuch a day Fiſh; to keep ſuch a kind of diet at one time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſuch a kind at another: To wear at ſuch a time ſuch and ſuch Veſtures and Garments (eſpecially upon a Politick and Civil Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count) being Commanded and Required by the Magiſtrate, are
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:64183:39"/> then not to be accounted indifferent to us, becauſe they are Injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be obſerved of us, and required by the Magiſtrate to whom we owe Subjection by the Law of God. Thus you ſee this Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Liberty whereon we ſtand, is not a Liberty of Licentiouſneſs, to do what we liſt; neither is it a Civil or Corporal Liberty of our Bodies from all kind of Service and Servitude under others: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it ſuch a Liberty as doth Exempt us from Obedience to our Lawful Magiſtrates and to the Juſt Laws of our Land, requiring nothing of us which is contrary to the Word of God.</p>
               <p>You will ſay now, What kind of Liberty then is it which the Apoſtle doth here perſwade us to ſtand faſt in wherewith Chriſt hath made us Free?</p>
               <p>We anſwer, it is a Spiritual Liberty of the Soul and Spirit, whereby we ſerve the Lord Chriſt willingly and cheerfully in Spirit and Truth, being freed from the Bondage of the old Law. If you look upon the Words there going before and following after, you will plainly find (and all Interpreters do agree upon it) that the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh there of that Liberty whereby we are freed by Chriſt from the Obſervation of the Law, which he calleth there the Yoke of Bondage. Thus St. <hi>Peter</hi> alſo ſpeaketh of them, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 10. <hi>Why tempt ye God to lay a Yoke on the Diſciples Neckes which neither we nor our Fathers were able to bear?</hi> For preſently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter St. <hi>Paul</hi> inſiſteth upon Circumciſion, becauſe Circumciſion was the Ground of all the Service of the Law, and that which was chiefly urged by the falſe Apoſtles. Thus he ſpeaketh there, <hi>v.</hi> 2. <hi>Behold I</hi> Paul <hi>ſay unto you, If you be Circumciſed, Chriſt ſhall profit you nothing;</hi> that is, If you be Circumciſed with that mind and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (which the falſe Apoſtles pretend) as that you look and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to be Juſtified by Circumciſion, and by keeping of the Law, then ſhall Chriſt profit you nothing. Chriſt profiteth onely them which Renounce their own Righteouſneſs, the Righteouſneſs of the Law, and fly to the Promiſe of Grace made in Chriſt by Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, and by Faith applying to themſelves the Merits of the Death of Chriſt, and reſting upon him alone, and upon that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of mercy made in him for the Forgiveneſs of their Sins, and for the Salvation of their Souls. For no man can keep the Law; therefore no man can expect to be Saved by the Law: But the Curſe of the Law muſt needs lie upon him without Chriſt. This
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:64183:39"/> is that Liberty which the Apoſtle there doth inſiſt upon. If you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be farther ſatisfied in this Point of Chriſtian Liberty; Be pleaſed to take it in theſe Particulars.</p>
               <q>Our Chriſtian Liberty Conſiſteth</q>
               <p n="1">1. In a Liberty or Freedom from the Power or Dominion of Sin, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 14. <hi>For ſin ſhall not have the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over you; for you are not under the Law but under Grace;</hi> From the Tyranny and Bondage of Satan. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2. 14, 15. <hi>Christ took part with us, that he might deſtroy through death, him that had the power of death, which is the Devil, and that he might deliver them which for fear of death were all their life time ſubject unto Bondage;</hi> And from the Torments of the Second Death. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1. <hi>There is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jeſus.</hi> So that true Believers, though they have ſin ſtill dwelling and abiding in them; yet are delivered from the Power, Raign, Rule and Dominion of ſin; are not Slaves and in Bondage under Satan, nor in danger of Eternal Death.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In a Liberty and Freedome from the Moral Law, but not in reſpect of Obedience, but in reſpect of the Rigour, Curſe and Condemnation of the Law; The Obligation to puniſhment: For whereas the Law requireth of us perfect Righteouſneſs, we do not look to be Juſtified by the Righteouſneſs of the Law, but by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt; according to that, <hi>Galath.</hi> 3. 13. <hi>Christ hath redeemed us from the curſe of the Law, being made a curſe for us; for it is written, Curſed is every one that hangeth on a Tree.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. In the Liberty of the Spirit, The gift of the Holy Ghoſt which doth inwardly Seal unto us the former Mercies, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8 15, 16. <hi>For we have not Received the Spirit of Bondage to fear again, but we have Received the Spirit of Adoption, whereby we cry Abba Father.</hi> This Spirit of God taketh away the vail of Ignorance, Darkneſs, and Blindneſs from our Hearts; Inlightneth us by the Preaching of the Goſpel, in the true ſaving knowledge of Chriſt; Convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to God, and Quickning us with the life of Grace, willingly and cheerfully to obey God, according to that, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>Now the Lord is that Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is Liberty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. In a Freedom from the Ceremonial Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> from the Sacraments, Sacrifices and Services of the Old Law, which were
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:64183:40"/> Impoſed on the people of God, and were Types and Shadowes of things to come, and ended in Chriſt. The Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Galat.</hi> 2. 4. <hi>of falſe Brethren which were craftily ſent in and crept in privily</hi> (ſaith he of thoſe times) <hi>to ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e out our Liberty, which we have in Chriſt Jeſus, that they might bring us into Bondage. To whom we gave not place by Subjection for an hour; that the Truth of the Goſpel might continue with you.</hi> And from the neceſſity of obſerving thoſe Legal Rites, Orders and Ordinances which concerned things Indifferent; The choice of certain Meats, thé Obſervations of daies and the like; As alſo from all the Traditions of Men Inſtituted in the worſhip of God as neceſſary to Salvation or putting Religion in them. Chriſt hath delivered us from all theſe; Yet notwithſtanding all this, Chriſtian Liberty doth not at all Exempt us from our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to our Lawful Magiſtrates or to the Laws of our Land, Commanding and requiring that which is Lawful and not contrary to the Word of God, and Inſtituting and Injoyning thoſe things without any opinion of placing any Religion, Worſhip or Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity in them, but in a Civil and Politick manner, onely for the Edification of the Church, onely for Order, Difference and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency. Thus you plainly ſee, This Chriſtian Liberty (which is pretended) cannot be Extended to things Indifferent in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or to theſe Ceremonies, being Indifferent in themſelves and Lawful in themſelves, no way Repugnant to the word of God, and Inſtituted and Injoyned onely in a Civil and Politick way for Difference, Order and Decency, without laying any neceſſity up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them for Salvation, or placing any Religion or Holyneſs in them. Therefore, Theſe that either Stubbornly contemne them, or Odiouſly contend againſt them, cannot but give juſt Occaſion of Scandal and Offence; As they are guilty of the Breach of Charity, ſo they Break the very Bond of Order, and deny their Obedience which is due unto the Magiſtrate.</p>
               <p>But you will ſtill Reply; We cannot be perſwaded, that you take theſe Ceremonies to be Indifferent in themſelves, to be done or left undone: But that you lay ſome kind of neceſſity upon them, becauſe they are ſo ſtrictly Urged, Required and Commanded; and thereby our Chriſtian Liberty is Infringed.</p>
               <p>To this we Anſwer; All acknowledge, that theſe things are in their own nature Indifferent, which are neither neceſſary to be
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:64183:40"/> done nor ſinful being done; may be done or left undone without ſin; which are morally neither Good nor Evil, and in Scripture neither Commanded nor Forbidden. Thus theſe things, Theſe Ceremonies in their own Nature are neither Good nor Evil, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Commanded in Scripture nor Forbidden: But being ſet up, appointed and Commanded by our Governours and Magiſtrates, our Obedience to them is neceſſary (as long as no Impiety is found in them, as not contrary to the Word of God) and not Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. We have ſhewed you already the Difference between the Neceſſity of the Impoſition of a thing, and our Neceſſity of Obedience to it, when it is Impoſed: To cleer it farther to you take it thus.</p>
               <p>There be two kind of Neceſſities, which are incident to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Ordinances in the caſes of Indifferent things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Neceſſity of Obedience to the Commandment, This Neceſſity of Obedience to Humane Precepts and Commands in things Lawful and Indifferent, is ſo far from prejudicing Chriſtian Liberty, that God himſelf hath Eſtabliſhed this Neceſſity in his Church, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 7. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 1. This Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Obedience cannot properly contradict our Chriſtian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, though accidentally by reaſon of the multitude of Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions it may be much wronged.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Neceſſity of the Doctrine of that Commandment. The Opinion of the Neceſſity of the Impoſition of it. This Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Neceſſity is, when a Man ſhall give to any Humane Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any of thoſe Properties, which are Eſſential to Divine Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Theſe Properties, are principally Three.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Immediately to Bind the Conſciences of Men.</item>
                  <item>2. To be a Neceſſary meanes to Salvation.</item>
                  <item>3. To hold it altogether unalterable by the Authority of Man.</item>
               </list>
               <q>Theſe Points do Infer a Doctrine of Divine Neceſſity.</q>
               <p>Such kind of Preſcriptions and Orders which contain in them any Opinion of Doctrinal Neceſſity, whenſoever they ſhall be Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained of Man, though they concern onely the outward Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Gods worſhip, yet are contrary to the Word of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 11, 12, 15. We may not ſtamp the mark of neceſſity upon any Doctrine, whereupon God hath ſet his Stamp of Indifferency to uſe it or not to uſe it. So that it is the Doctrinal Opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:64183:41"/> Ceremonies. That is, the onely Proper cauſe of depriving Chriſtians of that Liberty in Queſtion, which Chriſt commended to his Church in reſpect of things Indifferent. <hi>Polanus</hi> reduceth thoſe Errours which make Circumſtances of Worſhip truely Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, to Four Heads.</p>

Thus <hi>Calvin</hi> ſheweth, that it is not the Neceſſity of Obedience to Mans Commandment, but the Neceſſity in Opinion of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of Man. The Opinion of the Neceſſity of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of Man that annuileth our Liberty, our Chriſtian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in things of themſelves Indifferent: Now though our Church doth challenge a Neceſſity of Obedience to her Command, yet doth ſhe not Command or Teach any uſe of theſe Ceremonies in any Opinion of the Neceſſity of them; but that they are Retained for Diſcipline and Order, and on juſt cauſes may be altered and changed, and not to be equal to Gods Law.</p>

                  <label>Anſw.</label> We acknowledge Chriſt to be the Head of the Church, as it is, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1. 18. And that he hath given full and perfect Laws to his Church for the Matter and Subſtance of his Worſhip; and in ſome things for the Manner of his Worſhip. But we muſt know Laws are of Generals: Thus there be General Rules or Laws given by Chriſt, which for matter of Subſtance may not be altered; we may neither adde to them, nor diminiſh from them; but for matters of Circumſtance, that being Indifferent and variable in the Particulars, they may be altered or aboliſhed as the Peace and Edification of the Church ſhall require. So that Chriſtian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with the State and Church may Ordain ſuch Orders by thoſe General Rules, as may be Judged fitting by them for Order, Decency and Edification of the Church, ſo that the Service of God be not put in them, but appointed onely for Diſcipline and Order. This is no addition to Gods Command; we adde nothing Eſſential to the Doctrine or Worſhip of God. That which is added is onely Accidental and Circumſtantial, the better to inforce Gods Command, and the better to perform the Service and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God. There is an addition of Corruption, and an addition of Preſervation. We may not adde any thing to Corrupt the Doctrine and Worſhip of God, thereby to wrong it, weaken it or adulterate it; but theſe circumſtantial Additions are onely the better to preſerve the True Doctrine and the Pure Worſhip and Reverent Service of God. And that the Church hath taken Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in theſe things that are ſuch, may eaſily appear by many inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the Old and New Teſtament. We find many Ceremonies by Man Inſtituted in the Service of God, not preſcribed by the Word of God. <hi>Solomons</hi> Altar which he made occaſionally, 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 8. 64. had no particular Warrant from the Word of God. The Feaſt of <hi>Purim</hi> ordained by the Jews, <hi>Eſtth.</hi> 9. 27. and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be kept throughout their Generations, and the Feaſt of the Dedication of the Altar Inſtituted by the <hi>Macchabees</hi> and the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:64183:42"/> people, 1 <hi>Machab.</hi> 2. 59. which Chriſt himſelf did honour with his preſence, <hi>John</hi> 10. 22. were not preſcribed by the Law of God. And the Jews had Synagogues for the Reading and Preaching of the Word of God, yet we find no command in the Old Teſtament for the Building of them: Again, in the time of the New Teſtament, In the Apoſtles time, there were their Feaſts of Charity, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by that in the Epiſtle of <hi>Jude v.</hi> 12. and they had their <hi>Oſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum Pacis,</hi> their Holy Kiſſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 20. which was <hi>Signaculum Reconciliationis,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 26. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 14. yet neither of theſe preſcribed by God. If any man ſay theſe were Apoſtolical Inſtitutions, yet they were not Divine; but in them the Apoſtles Acted as Governours of the Church. For we count, that Divine Inſtitutions are ſuch, as were Ordained for Perpetual uſe in the Church; Apoſtolical ſuch as were Ordained by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, with a power to alter them as they ſaw good, and thoſe were altered; Eccleſiaſtical, ſuch which the Church after the Apoſtles did anywhere Ordain, which are likewiſe ſubject to alteration. All know that it was the Univerſal Cuſtome in all Chriſtian Churches throughout the world, That in the Primitive times they uſed (ſtanding) in time of Publick Prayers, upon all the Lords daies between <hi>Eaſter</hi> and <hi>Whitſontide,</hi> which was Appointed by the Church in thoſe times, to ſignifie their Faith of Chriſts Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. And the Feaſts of <hi>Eaſter</hi> and <hi>Whitſontide</hi> or <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by the Church, were alwaies obſerved and kept to this day. To all theſe I may Adjoyn the Ancient Practice of the Jews, who unto the Inſtitution of that great Feaſt of the Paſſeover preſcribed to them by <hi>Moſes,</hi> had (as the <hi>Rabbines</hi> witneſs) added both Signs and Words; adding their Sawce called <hi>(Charaſeth)</hi> thick like Muſtard, to be a Memorial of the Clape, wherein they wrought in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> therein dipping the bitter Hearbs, and drinking Wine, with theſe Words to Both; <hi>Take and Eate theſe in Remembrance,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Drink this in Remembrance,</hi> &amp;c.

The Chriſtian Magiſtrate may drive the negligent to hear the Word of God Preached; may alſo puniſh wicked Diſpiſers, Blaſphemers, Hereticks, Schiſmacicks, Idolaters and the like: And how can this be done but by Laws Made and Eſtabliſhed by the Church? Then ſome Laws may be added about Particular Circumſtances which are variable. Yet we do not take the power of making Laws out of Gods hand, or any ways adde to the Laws of God; we do onely Inforce the keeping of Gods Laws for Order, Decency and Diſcipline, that all may be done Decently and Orderly in the Church of God: We acknowledge, that the Kingdome of Chriſt is Spiritual. All the Kings of the Earth and Men of this world can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Convert one Soul to Chriſt; That is done by the Holy Ghoſt, by the lively Word of Faith; But the Civil Power is an outward mean to drive Men to hear the Word and Goſpel Preached, and to keep Order and obey Diſcipline. Chriſts Subjects again are willing Subjects, ſo far as his Word and Spirit hath wrought upon them to ſubdue them. But before Men be Converted, Compulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons even with Penalties are often and ordinarily a way and means to bring them to that, whereby this work of Converſion is wrought. It is ſaid of that good King <hi>Joſias,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34. 33. <hi>That he took away all the abominations out of all the Countries that pertained to the Children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and compelled, all that were found in</hi> Iſrael <hi>to ſerve the Lord their God.</hi> And of <hi>Aſa</hi> King of <hi>Judah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14. 4. <hi>That he commanded</hi> Judah <hi>to ſeek the Lord God of their Fathers,</hi> &amp;c.

That is the Trueſt and Sureſt Rule to go by: Examine the xxxix. Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, agreed upon by all our Divines, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1562. which are called by ſome Our Engliſh Creed, containing the ſumme of our Faith, and the Doctrine of our Church. The <hi>xxth.</hi> Article ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth plainly in the end of it. Though the Church be the keeper of Gods Word: Yet, as it ought not to Decree any thing againſt the Word of God, ſo beſides the ſame ought it not to inforce any thing to be Believed for Neceſſity of Salvation. And again, in the end of Artic. 34. Every Particular or National Church hath Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to Ordain, Change and Aboliſh Ceremonies and Rites, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained onely by mans Authority, ſo that all things be done to Edifying. And for Particulars, ſearch the Canons of our Church made <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1603. where in the <hi>30th.</hi> Canon the lawful uſe of the Croſs in Baptiſm is fully Explained thus: That it is no part of the Subſtance of that Sacrament; being uſed, addeth nothing to the Perfection and Vertue of Baptiſm, nor being omitted detracteth
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:64183:43"/> any thing from the Effect and Subſtance of it, but is uſed onely (as Primitively as a Lawful outward Ceremony and Honourable Badge, whereby the Infant is Dedicated to the Service of him that died upon the Croſs. And for Decency of Apparel Injoyned to Miniſters in Can. 74. thus; All which Particulars concerning Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel preſcribed, our meaning is not to Attribute any Holineſs or ſpecial Worthineſs to the ſaid Garments, but for Decency, Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and Order. Now if you find in the General Doctrine of our Church (which is Viſible and ought to be (in Charity) the Rule of Judging Particulars) that ſhe doth not onely diſclaim thoſe Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious Grounds, but doth farther declare, The Grounds of ſuch General Impoſition of all theſe Ceremonies to be onely in a Civil manner to be Impoſed for Diſtinction, Order, Decency and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, and not for any Religious Opinion that they put in them; you have little Reaſon to be Jealous or Suſpicious of any ill meaning in your Governours, to whom you owe Charity (which thinketh no Evil) as well as Obedience and Submiſſion.</p>
               <p>Here you ſee fully and plainly; that Chriſtian Libertie is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Duty and Obedience which we owe to our Governours and Lawful Magiſtrates, but rather Tieth us (in things Indifferent, Lawful, and not Contrary to the Words of God) to all kind of Duty to all our Lawful Governours. To Fathers, to Maſters, to Husbands, to Paſtours, to Magiſtrates, Kings and Rulers, and by the ſtrongeſt Bonds of Obedience. <hi>Of Wrath,</hi> (as the Scripture ſpeaketh) <hi>Of Conſcience, and for the Lords ſake.</hi>

Here you have his Judgement not onely of the Perfection of this Book of Common Prayer, but alſo of the very firſt Making and Compoſing of this Book, who doubtleſs knew the Truth and ſpake the Truth. For this was ſpoken by him within Four years (if you Examine the time) after this Book was made and Confirmed by that Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth. So that no man can truely ſay or Judge that this Book of Common Prayer is Popery, or was taken out of the Popiſh <hi>Maſs Book,</hi> much leſs that it was the <hi>Maſs Book</hi> Tranſlated; Seeing it was ſet forth by King <hi>Edward</hi> (as he affirmeth) made with great Deliberation and the Advice of the beſt Learned of the Realm.
